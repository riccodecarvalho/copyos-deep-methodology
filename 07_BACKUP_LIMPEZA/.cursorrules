# COPYOS™ - Cursor Agent Configuration

## Project Overview
This is a copywriting system based on Stefan Georgi's RMBC II methodology, implemented with deep methodology and automated QA.

## Key Files to Focus On
- `01_BASE_DE_CONHECIMENTO/` - Main knowledge base with 8 volumes
- `02_PROMPTS/` - Optimized prompts for AI models
- `03_SCRIPTS/` - Automation scripts for processing volumes
- `blueprints/` - Structured blueprints for each volume
- `qa/` - Quality assurance reports

## Methodology
- **Two-Pass Pipeline**: Canonical extraction + Synthesis with rigid metas
- **Automated QA**: Validation with 100/100 score requirements
- **Deep Methodology**: Ensures content depth and actionable insights

## Quality Standards
Each volume must have:
- ≥3 literal citations (verified)
- ≥5 KPIs with formulas and thresholds
- ≥3 actionable templates
- ≥2 anti-examples with solutions
- Score 100/100 in automated QA

## File Structure
- Volumes 01-08 are complete and validated
- All scripts are functional and tested
- Prompts are optimized for ChatGPT, Gemini, and other LLMs

## When Working on This Project
1. Always maintain the deep methodology standards
2. Use the existing scripts for automation
3. Validate any changes with the QA system
4. Keep the structure organized and documented
5. Focus on actionable, practical content

## Important Notes
- Large files (evidencias/, 04_DADOS_BRUTOS/) are gitignored
- The project is ready for production use
- All volumes have been processed with 100/100 quality scores
