**‚â•2 casos de erro comum + como evitar:**

### Armadilha 1: [Nome do erro]
**O que acontece**: Alright, so today we're going to go through checkouts. You know, I did a module back in the day of my profit fix formula on checkouts, and honestly not like a whole lot has changed, so I don't think this will be a really long section. But if we're going through the whole funnel and the whole journey, then I would feel weird not also taking time to go through checkout. One thing to keep in mind is, by the time we get to a checkout, in general, in general, uhm, it should be formality, but we can't, like, assume that the person is going to buy. But what I mean by formality, I mean, you know, if we talk about the process as we've gone through this in other modules of RMBC, too, it's like you, you've educated, you've probably emotionally connected at some level, you've connected with the right prospects, right, you've had the right messaging for their product market awareness level, you've sold them on the product, the features, the benefits, the emotional aspect of it, uhm, you've educated them, right, about yourself, you've shown them a social proof, you've validated it more broadly, right, with testimonials and things of that nature, oh my god, things of that nature, here I go again, uhm, so at this point, it's just time to buy. And, so all we're really going to do in this video is go through some examples of different brands and look at the checkouts, and then in the next section on upsells, I'm gonna, I'm gonna actually buy all of these, my wife's gonna be like, what the hell, all these random things come, and, uh, we'll see what they do for upsells, and we'll have some different ones up here, more direct response oriented, more, uh, you know, sort of Shopify, cleaner types of upsells as well. So, let's start with this Dr. Clean. If you recall from the native aspects of the advertorial section, they, we got through this funnel, which I really, like, do like their landing page, you know, their PDP a lot. It's really clean and sexy. I don't think I broke this one down on the PDP section, because I just started swiping things, but it's a really nice product page, you know, so I'll talk about that for a minute, but, oh, the design is, is really sexy, and you know, it's fun, it's funny, how should I say like this. I don't know if I've saved it already, but I'm gonna make sure I save it right now. Uhm, I mean, the margins are probably great. I don't know what the pricing is yet. That's actually something important to point out too, right? On the PDP, I probably should have talked about this in the PDP section. Sometimes you're showing the price in the prox, you know, the prox selection. Sometimes you're still hiding it, you're saying get a 65% off discount. So that's an interesting thing about the call to action, right? Might have to do a second video on the PDPs, because I don't want to take the checkout section and turn it into endless PDPs. But, okay, cool. But the margins are gonna be great. I mean, it's probably some cheap-ass cleaner, cost like cents, pennies to make, maybe like $1.50, I don't want, maybe they're, again, don't come at, don't at me, Dr. Clean, you know, I want to be shocked if, no, our cleaners, our cogs are actually very high, because it's so advanced, alright, whatever, I, you know, cool. This is a great page. But anyway, it was the advertorial about clean ovens, sorry, the ad about clean ovens, advertorial about clean ovens takes you to this page, which is sort of about every stain, so not just about clean ovens, okay, interesting. Let me get my 65% discount. Let's go to mobile, for this we gotta really check on mobile, okay? Great direct response elements here. Okay, scarcity, well, may not be true, it's always Mattel by the way. Do you think we could brands like? A direct response brand. We've got something like this, this, right? 65% off, like 59% left in stock, which is probably not true, which is like fake scarcity, but like, everyone does it, not saying you should do it, not condoning it, just saying. Okay, the discount's been applied, we've got a 10 minute timer for how long it's reserved for, so a lot of urgency. What do we see immediately up here? You're gonna see, save money, you've got a discount, low stock, you're only reserved for this period of time. Then we've got testimonials. This is interesting, you know, we just said we're gonna buy it, why are we seeing all this? You know why we're seeing all this? Because, I'm guessing the spray is pretty expensive for what is essentially just a, you know, common household cleaner, right? Drop shipped from China, most likely. Okay, so we've got testimonials, before-afters. Advanced formula, natural ingredients, okay. Look how amazing this is. Effortlessly erase every stain with Dr. Clean. Ditch all those ineffective cleaners, Dr. Clean makes your house spotless in minutes. All-purpose cleaning spray, eco-friendly, cost-effective, so we're kind of reminding them of the benefits. Reminding them of the social proof. Reminding them of what happens here, 30-day money-back guarantee, works on all surfaces, removes all stains. Choose your package, okay? So a single bottle is $20, right? How does that compare, to other products? They're all-purpose cleaners. Let's go to, like, Publix is, like, a grocery store chain in Florida, right? Okay. Method is $1.99. This is weird. I know why this is giving me this, because I didn't let it know my location. It's gonna be, like, weird Euro pricing. Okay, this is a bathroom all-purpose cleaner. It's Pine Sol. There's also a brand that they carry a lot called, like, Meyers. I'm gonna order ahead. Just show me Meyers. Oh, my God. Of course, your website's gonna suck. I was gonna Instacart. Okay. Meyers. Meyers is, like, an all-purpose cleaner. It's, like, non-toxic. We use them in our house. $4.99, okay? Lysol. It's $8. There's Meyers again. Method's $4.99. Lysol again, $5.99. All that kind of stuff, right? Okay. Let's go to Target real quick. Just see. Target has some other brands. Okay, a lot of the same things, but, you know, same pricing. $5.99, a little bit more expensive. I think, was Publix $5.99 or $4.99? I don't remember, but, Sorry, what was this one? Everspring. Okay, it looks like all organic and natural. $3. Okay, and then, What about something more bougie? Let's do Sprouts, I guess. Sprouts has, like, more organic stuff. Okay, we've got Zum. $6.99, 7th generation, $6.29. Okay, so the more organic stuff here, $6.99. Alright, you've got Cola Eco Kitchen Cleaner, Australian Lemon Myrtle. It's, like, exotic. That's nice. That's I'm looking for, and that's the price, oh, rich people would buy that, right? That's sort of top of market. Then, we've got our boy, Dr. Clean here, $19.95 for a single cleaner. Okay, and it goes down in price for the more cleaners you order. Thank you So, let's start with the package selection. Classic direct response, 1, 2, 3, 4. Why not 1, 3, 6? Sorry, I'm not trying to sound like it's dumb to ask those questions. It's just that, who knows? Who knows why not 1, 3, 6? Probably they've tested it, they seem pretty dialed in. They probably found that 1, 2, 3, 4 does better. Oh, you get these multi-purpose cleaning tablets. Well, that's not super clear, to get this bonus, right? But you save more. It shows you, I guess you get these cleaning tablets no matter what, but you get more. I do think, one opportunity, though. It's telling me what the cleaning tablets are, like it mentioned the bonus somewhere. Like, you know, I don't think you can fit it here if you're too busy, I'm not sure if they put it below, like, plus these cleaning tablets, right? Uhm, like, why do I, like, you know, okay, cool, I get these, it helps me a little bit, but it would be good, why not sell me a little more on the cleaning tablets. New Express Checkout PayPal, you know, your card, customer information, delivery address, all transactions are SSL secure and encrypted. You've got your total here, what you're saving, what your summary is, it's a nice checkout, right? Complete order, not buy now. Complete order feels, like, nice, feels nice to complete. Guarantee, happy customers, professional customer support, all this. But it's like, why do I need all this copy, all those pages, to sell a cleaning spray? It's because I'm going to charge you a crazy amount of money for a cleaning spray that's, like, triple the cost. Of what the market would normally charge, and another thing they could probably do, because people are kind of wary these days, I mean, it doesn't look like, I mean, I'm assuming this isn't a subscription, I'm not looking at my card. I'm not sure why they aren't really clear, like, with, like, you know, this is not a subscription, one-time purchase, I almost guarantee if they put that on their checkout, they would increase their conversion rate, because people are really wary of subscriptions, right, and it's not 100% clear. Presumably, if I go type in my address, I won't type it on the camera, it's going to tell me, let's see, like, ah, it's going to start suggesting, interesting that it's not, I wonder if that's, usually a lot of the places will have, like, you know, an enable to where it auto-completes your address for you, which also helps to reduce, you know, shipping errors and things, they don't have that, so that's interesting. So this is on desktop, go back to mobile, mobile is actually the way I would really look at most of this stuff here. You can complete order, okay? So I will, sales tax, processing, handling fees will be applied at the end of the ordering process. So what does that mean, right? Also, I'm getting one for $19.95. This is sneaky, right? So I've ordered one, my order summary is hidden. When I open it down, I'm getting a shipping warranty. So I'm basically getting a warranty for this. I'm removing that. Shipping isn't, you know, included. Fine, no big deal. Do the other ones include free shipping? That's another thing I would consider doing. But that warranty is very sneaky, right? It's free money for them, another reason why it's direct response. Um, so showing my total savings. So it's nice to really dialed in. It's kind of crazy that they're charging as much for a cleaner, but good DR elements. So that was our checkout for dr. Clean spray. I'm gonna save that checkout to have it for later. to another checkout here. Let's go back to David. Okay. So very branded e-com. Got one time purchase, subscribe and save. These guys are funny. I almost don't really want to order their stuff honestly because it's like okay milk protein tapioca starch modified plant fat. Like these bars are like not good. I don't know if that Huberman quote is even real, to be honest with you. Uhm, I guess I'll order a box to find out. So, we're going one important note here. Their checkout is sort of like a two-step. Like, the landing page is here. You're ordering twelve of these, which price-wise isn't terrible. It's less than, it's not, I mean, it's a little over three dollars a bar. But, like, it's not like the crazy, it's not crazy. So, we're going to do chocolate chip cookie dough. Okay, well I'll play again. I got more than 70 dollars, I get free shipping. So, let's say I do that right. So, I would consider that for Dr. Clean. Add to cart. I would assume I'm going to get the side thing. So, this is kind of more of a classic, uhm, Shopify checkout, right? This is cool. We have this, right? Hey, you get free shipping of two cartons, you get free gift for three cartons, for three cartons, and you get four cartons. But, it's a subscriber-safe option. Why subscribe? So, they're really trying to push you to subscription, right? More flavors you can add. This is like a, uh, Shopify widget, where it has, like, suggestions for, like, additional, uh, you know, trying to up your order value, your AOV. Reminds me of Fast and Secure Shipping, Satisfaction Guarantee, Temperature-Protected Packaging. Okay, cause that might be my big ob- Why is that important? That might be a big objection I have, like, what if the, what if they know that I live in Arizona, I live in Florida, I live in Las Vegas, or wherever, right? Uhm, but we're just gonna continue to checkout. And this is a very classic Shopify checkout. You've got these Express Pay options. Thank All these things. We'll give you shipping, uh, methods in a moment. Pay now. You got options to add other flavors before it's too late. So again, this is all about AOV. Right before it's too late, there's a little bit of scarcity. We have a discount code that shows up here. What about our friends at Clarifyon? So remember them, advertorials, this is sort of your product page, slash checkout, get 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9. Just pick one. Credit card, checkout right on this page. 10% off when you go on their email list. So, you know, they've got margin to spare on this, which this device costs them like $3 or something. Your shipping address, billing address and shipping address. order somewhere you can get the two-year protection plan. So this is their little order bump upsell. It's worth noting what we're doing here, right? So it's like the clean spray people have like a little shipping warranty that's very sneakily added. At least Clarifines is not as sneakily added. I'm not going to add that. One device, free shipping, guarantee. Terms of use. Should actually just click on it here. It's doing the same thing. New page. Like, my little video bubble disappeared. So I'm gonna finish this example and then we'll do a part two video. The biggest thing I'm doing, why am I looking here, is to see if they have a subscription policy, right? Which I can't read upon. So you may have an option to do these things. If you purchase a subscription, right, it will be billed, you can cancel. Basically, what's not clear to me, again, is, And by the way, it's a picture, so you can't copy and paste it, right? So it's shady AF. So my question, again, is, like, Let's see. Is this a subscription? I don't know. And so even doing, like, a demo here, Because I think it's sort of a little bit shady, I'm not going to buy this one and even see what the upsells are. I mean, I might? But I don't really trust these people, so I'm not going to buy from them. But, you know, check out, You got that bump again. This is interesting, the 10% off when you opt in. Again, to me, like, I really think it hurts people's conversions every time by not saying no subscription if it's not a subscription. Alright, we'll do some more checkouts, but I'm going to do it on, uh, a second video.

Alright, welcome back to part two. Alright, so to clarify on which I'm not gonna buy, um, I don't know, again, I think, let me see something. I think it takes you back to the abritorial every time. Let me see. No, it doesn't. Okay, so let's save that checkout too. How do I save David? Yeah, David protein check. Yeah, let's save that one. Alright, let's go to another one. Here's our friends at Happy Mammoth. They have their nice, long page. I really feel like I should buy one that I would actually, I'm not gonna use any of these though, to be honest with you. Let's buy one. So, same thing here, we'll just once you get here, it's sort of like a classic Shopify checkout. Little countdown timer for like scarcity. You can check out using all the shop options. It's a two-step being what you put this stuff in and then continue to shipping. Uhm, they have testimonials, social proof, right? Why are these here? Well, it helps to push you over the edge. You're Oh, man, it's $69. I don't know But then it's like, uh, hey, it really works. It just further validates the purchase to push you over the edge, right? That's really just why we're doing these. You know, I think one thing I might look at is these testimonials are all from 2024. I would probably spend a year. One thing I would do if I was Happy Mammoth is I'd probably update to like get some ones there from 2025. So I'm not like, oh, is this old? Uh, like, are people still buying this? Like, you know, being with the average person's experience, it's not like they know these things. So there's definitely some person out there that's like, you know, they saw an ad, they're like, oh, maybe this brand's not around anymore. Like, oh, I don't want to buy it. Like, you know, whatever it is. And so such a little thing you can do just to update a purchase. More recent testimonials. So this is going to do address. Let me do, I'll do an old address for this. That was all right. That's fine. This is my actual address. So that's cool. Continue to shipping. I got a manual address. Shipping. Shipping, okay. You can do overnight, two or three days. Continue to payment. Bill. Okay, so I'm going to go back because I'll actually buy this from, uh, you know, to go through, see what the upsells look like. Something I hate at the shop thing. That's funny. But whoever's address this is, their phone number is linked to it. Poor person. Um, but okay. Let's have you, ma'am. This was just interesting. Actually, I clicked on an Emma ad where we were talking about advertorials earlier. And, um, some of the new ads Emma's testing are actually going to an advertorial, but why? Because they're trying to do a risk-free free trial. One bottle risk-free probably retargeting more than new customer acquisition. I don't know. Maybe not, but I thought it was interesting. We can click on this. I don't actually want to Whatever is free one That's weird Okay, nevermind. So it's trying it was free. I just funny. I really hate this language cuz I'm like, oh they're trying to get me to subscribe It's a subscription But when you click on it, it just goes to one of their landers Right. So I'm just really nice or PDPs But funnily enough, it's not actually for a subscription I thought this must be I thought that page must be I'm like, oh surely You know, they're testing advertorial to then sell like a one-bottle subscription plan, but they're not so all the risk-free stuff to me is like And maybe it works it's worth a test yours because Emma but my assumption would be Probably doesn't work as well because again, I just think people are really burned on subscription That's one of your big takeaways for today's Okay. All right. Well, let's get a bottle of Emma so I can get that stuck poop out of me. Okay, so I don't want to donate these to charity or something Okay, so you got your little selections grab and save or one time One time what's this gravity pricing better one time, you know, I feel don't notice this stuff is checked, you know, but It makes sense to have it. I mean what? What's the take rate 50% probably? All right claim your supply now not buy now claim your supply now it's important it's like The copy on this button really and people talk about like button changes like the color and they make fun of it But honestly what is on this button actually does really matter right like add to cart by now try it Risk-free claim your supply now if these things actually do make a difference You know, yeah, I'm sure they tested this a lot they found claim your supply now to be the best one pack Claim my supply now Comes here. This is Custom checkout not Shopify but looks kind of a lot like the Shopify Check out, right? Okay, you've got that reserved timer you can see a commonality here Let's look on mobile in a minute, but I'll look not mobile first your story can be next. Okay, so they've got these testimonials Again, push you over the edge. Wow. This is great. I loved it Security no subscription see no subscription. Nope Open fees. This is one time right? This is like so important. I Don't know why other brands aren't doing this that alone if you're a brand Probably pay for RBC like a hundred times over or many more times if you're at scale. Okay, um, what you've got here one bottle Credit card place to order Try and live it money back guarantee My so guarantee this doctor is their spokesperson You know, you're automatically checked in to get Perched, you know Stay up to date with your purchase that were confirmation I am curious of this SMS check-in if they actually leave it to that if they actually do marketing Like which technically they need to disclose here Here's one other thing that I would always and look at testing on the checkout if they're able to it comes out of functionality It was Shopify and I don't think they're using Shopify Maybe they are. I know I could find out but um One thing I would like to see is like the option to like switch to a different amount, right They may have tested this before But I'm not sure But it's like if I come here There's one bottle and it's like if I could see or toggle between one three and six and see that okay three and Or six is like I'm gonna save more money the price for bottles lower You might be able to pick up some more AOV here on the checkout page, right? Let's look on mobile real quick here It's kind of important here's why it's important right because This one is pretty obvious. Let me see Happy Mammoth David These guys are kind of surprising was one interesting thing is they don't have Like the Checkout field above the fold normally on a checkout You just get right to the information Again, the reason why these guys don't have that I think is because they're charging such a crazy amount of money for a cleaner, right? but typically Typically you want to just get ready to gather information Again a conversion and they put this stuff down below because usually it's more important to like Yeah, I could remind them what they're saying It also be good if they showed what they're saving here, which it doesn't have again I don't know that there are limitations the functionality different checkouts. I'd like to see what they're saving Prices reserved come down here place your order now, right? I would Wonder about again even putting I'm testing things. I know like, you know, this is not copy but like whatever Um, I would consider testing putting these things Up higher. I think it's honestly more important than jeans. I honestly don't think this has a lot of value. I think that You already used her, you know in ads or advertorials landing pages video sales letters, whatever it is. I Don't believe that she I don't believe that this is so important to give me to convert and the guarantee is important and I think Reminding me that there's no subscription all that so I would bet Could be wrong. I would bet Putting this part stuff at least I don't care if you have to do this whole thing because you're trying to save space but Oops This part here like my bet would be that doing that Where this is would actually increase conversion is a pretty good amount could be wrong. I would bet money Probably like a 10% lift at least my bet. Okay, so There's our friends at Emma Okay, this was um the pain report is that Sino cell one So I haven't muted. I did have it muted. Let the VSL go All right, let's see I get Sino cell So let's look at the package options real quick You got one bottle, six bottles, three bottles, pretty classic, six is in the middle $59 a bottle, $39 a bottle, pretty classic pricing Okay, they all look good. I get this mind body mind ebooks When I do this when I get fast free shipping, when I do this when I get fast free shipping Doctor's choice, interesting right, support, pain hero Doctor's choice, interesting title for these things, um Get the guarantee for all of them, everything like that, okay? Let's go with a single bottle because I'm not trying to spend, I'm still going to spend like a f****** grand doing this so, this is one of my RBC sales but Let's select, save this page for now, to, single bottle again, I do wonder if the upsells sometimes, we'll get to that when we get to the upsells. Alright, basically the exact same template as like Emma, right? I mean literally, I don't think it's the same company, maybe it is, no this is Conscious, oh it is actually the same company, I'm pretty sure, cause it's like Conscious, which is probably Conscious Keto, which is the same thing as Enclave, which is probably Emma, so, makes sense, okay? Gonna be basically the exact same checkout, probably the same thing instead of optimizations, gonna work here, is here, right? So, I'm not gonna go through this one, because it's basically the exact same thing, because it's literally the same company. Uhm, which I know, total checkout, but now I know, interesting, okay. How about, this one, this is a capital syndicate thing, that was like the, uhm, advertorial, or sorry, it was like the meta ad, I'll show This VSL Was this guy, right, the capital syndicate Went to this advertorial Advertorial went to this VSL I don't even know what it is Add to cart, click here to get started Add to cart, let's see The capital syndicate digital training course and bonuses we Arnold scripts and templates capital amplifier broker portal This is a digital product available for instant access They probably put that because on one hand people will think like oh am I getting like Things in the mail, but they're trying to do a benefit because it's available for instant access, right? Phone number up here is good. Do we see that with any of these other people like Emma? They've got this email, okay. Oh My god, that's my whole unhealthy ones from forever ago, um It's another thing if I'm Emma, I guess they're not doing call centers to me. That's some shocking because it's like I Don't know if they've tested this or not But why would you not let people call in because anyone who's on the fence like right if you're So here's basically I understand this if you have an affiliate if affiliates are running to your page They don't want a phone number here. Why because some percentage of people will call in And go You know, I have questions and the call center will sell them You'll make money the affiliate sends you the click sends you the customer and didn't get paid But if you're not running for affiliates, which I don't think that Emma or Sinocell does a lot I would probably put a phone number up because Maybe they've tested it, but if they haven't Probably would get more sales. They didn't and this is also why Even really big brands like people who you see crushing it They almost always have plenty of things they could be doing that would further increase revenue and optimize And most of the time that's true and I see in CA pro all the time Like I've got 70 plus businesses all doing between three and three hundred million a year D to C Mostly kind of EECOM, DREECOM, hybrids stuff like that. I help them find wins all the time, right? So like Yeah, I don't know I just think uh It's not gonna be testing anyway, this guy has it, okay You know, it's fine, if you buy RMBC, you have the same address as mine, that's cool, right? Okay. Komodo Certification Authority, I don't know what, this is fine, I don't know what Komodo Certification Authority is, but Let's see, set the timer, right up here, phone number, continue, that was step one Step two Okay, your name, your card, information like that Here's what you're about to receive, lifetime membership to the Capital Syndicate, the five-module Capital Syndicate training course, done for you marketing scripts and templates Capital Connector call scripts, sample fee agreement, Capital Syndicate loan checklist, exclusive access to my broker portal, secure online software Private equity fund, Rolodex, special capital, okay, I didn't watch the VSL, so I don't really know what they're offering, 30-day guarantee Let's provide a great experience We can contact you, text you, call you, right Let's say personal information Words from fellow students, okay, wow, like, social proof, FAQs, kind of interesting Doing the FAQs on the checkout Is this a subscription or a one-time payment? It's a one-time payment, alright, okay, thank you At least I have it here Hey, we want to give you an awesome experience You can trust us Here's all the stuff you're getting, right again The offer bump is interesting Step-by-step guidebook, okay, so it's $97 dog. Click the guidebook, $27, okay Here's a really interesting thing about offer bumps I've said this before, but, you know, plenty of people probably won't have heard me say it Uhm, while they can add to the AOV, like, they can increase your, you know, sort of pre-upsell AOV Sometimes you'll find that when you do these, the, they actually hurt your overall final AOV So, it's important to test this You may be thinking, well, why? How could, how could that be, Stephan? Uh, well, the reason it could be Sorry, I have some kind of nicotine product to satiate me here The reason it could be Is because somebody buys an extra thing here, and it's the upsell, they're like, ah, I already bought something extra The problem with that can be That I added $27 here. Maybe your upsell is for $100 or $49 or $149 or $97 or whatever it is. And so Say you get 40% of people to take this thing for $27. Okay, so like 0.4 So basically this contributes to your AOV $10.80, okay Cool. Well, let's say You have an upsell that goes for $97 and you Get 20% of people to take it. Okay, so $10.80, remember that number What if you had, you know, 20% of people take the $97 one? $19.40, right? So Cool, but what if because of The order bump Now only, you know, 7% of people take it Okay, I can choose $6.79. Now you may be saying, yeah Well, plus the $10.80, so $10.80 plus $6.79 It's like Around $18, right? True, but if it was 0.2 here, you made $1.40 more, so Doesn't seem like a lot, but it actually does add up, right? So hence why it makes sense to test these things Because everyone thinks, the good thing about these offer bumps is that like, yeah, your conversion rate's high. The bad thing is It could actually make your AOV lower And depending on what's in your upsells and stuff like that, you know You may want to reconsider that. Okay. Alright, cool. I think that was all the checkout examples I wanted to share Again, what's cool about this one, and again, if it's a digital product, it makes sense, is you're doing like the offer stack. Again, social proof. It'd be better if it was like pictures of people, probably. Mentioned the offer bump thing, everything there. Oh, yeah, the phone number, some of the timer, right? Let's go to mobile, see what mobile looks like. So mobile, see, like, right, you got the phone number here, the bump, the stack is down here, all these things, right, FAQs, which is helpful. I still, again, I'm going to be a dead horse if I be like, you know, this is a one-time purchase, not a subscription, you know, blah, blah, blah, right? I still put that every time. If I'm not selling a subscription, right? Let me actually do one more thing. Let's say I was going to subscribe and save, right? I'm going to save 13% off, paying for shipping. So now, it doesn't say no subscription, because it is a subscription, right, reoccurring every time. So, it's not like a huge, really noticeable thing, but, you know, it is showing you a subscription. They don't really do a ton of changes, like, oh my god, it's a subscription. You know, there's a fine line there, like, you don't really want to hide it from consumers. Many people have done that. I've made lots of money, but it's super shady and not sustainable long-term, uhm, but, you also don't want to, like, hammer them so much that they're like, oh god, okay, maybe I shouldn't take this subscription. So, there's a fine line for that, right? Uhm, but again, one thing, and just, I don't know if I said this, but, compared to Happy Mammoth, one thing to note is, like, how they don't have dates on these, which means they can last longer. Right? You can argue either way. Maybe the dates, people go, wow, that's really recent. I actually like dates, but then you kind of need to update your testimonials pretty regularly if you're going to do dates. Okay, so anyway, that concludes checkouts. We will then go and do upsells, and I'll see you in the upsell module. Alright, goodbye.

### Template 2: Template 2

Alright, let's get our quad project 4. Doing, I should make this bigger, uh, emo sequences, okay? Should be pretty helpful. And do it here. This is why I waste my time. Look, basic instructions, okay? Your job is to create various emo sequences for different products and services that will range from econ products to coaching or information products. I mean, do this, like, it doesn't matter. This, I have it, it's fine. You have several documents in your knowledge base that should provide all the examples you need to write great sequences. You'll see that there are several examples for abandoned car emails, welcome emo series for new customers, special sales and promotion series, flash sales, reorder series, for getting a customer to order more of a product prior to running out, win back series, uhm, so basically everything we went through in the previous part of this, you know, in the email series section you looked at. You'll also notice that some of the sequences focus more heavily on discounting, while some focus more on emotion. What will happen is that I will give you instructions about the kind of email sequence I'm looking to have written, as well as the product or service or brand we are running the sequence for. You'll then select from relevant examples, synthesizing across several of them when necessary to create a new sequence. Okay? Cool. Looks like I did it here. All right, so. Let's kind of go back into the wild, right? UDI Serum. What should we do? Let's do a, Uh, to start, let's do a 7-day abandoned cart sequence for UDI. UDI Serum. Uh, let's focus on, I ain't gonna do much today. Let's, uhm, introduce a 20% off discount on day. Day 3. Increase it to a 40% off discount on day 5. Uh, so days 5 through 7. Can you please outline this sequence for me. Uh, then after I approve, I'll have you write it. So I'll save this prompt, that's what this prompt is like. Sorry, didn't include the link. So I'm gonna just do this, I'm gonna start over again. So, like, you're knowledge base. Looks pretty good. And write it, I'm just gonna write one note for the tone. Female, one, and then general. Make sure it is empathetic, supportive. Be still. Painful. We want to do it more like, you've experienced this, or some of our customers share that. To do is sound like we're assuming things about the prospect. Some of our customers who share that they feel hesita- uhm, or maybe like some of our customers who feel- share that they feel hesitant to invest in themselves because they've been disappointed before. I completely understand these feelings. What I can tell you is that UDI certainly works differently than anything you've likely tried before. Uhm, kind of explains the science of it, testimonials, you deserve to feel confident, you deserve the rightness, it's waiting to complete your order, here's the guarantee, or you're protected. Okay, why your eyes- might age faster. There's no reason other items don't work. So we're gonna educate them a bit, here's why ours works better, cool. 20% off. 20% off, here's a, you know, terms of our stock. Objection handling. Increases kind of urgency. So I mean, you can play with the results, but like, it's still right, it's pretty cool, right? Alright. Nice, right? I'm gonna copy it. And I'm gonna save this one, let's see. Alright, so I saved the emails, you can look through them. They seem pretty solid. Which is pretty cool. As well they should. Cool, right? So. What else can we do? Give me a second to prepare this and I'll show you. Alright, so let me show you what I'm doing here, okay? I'm gonna say, now let's do a new customer welcome sequence for UDI Serum. Let's have it be 10 emails. In email number 3, let's introduce our opaline rich cream as a great compliment to UDI Serum. Give the customer a 20% off coupon code, they can use it while ordering it. In email number 7, let's introduce our citric whipped aloe and also offer a 20% off. In email number 10, let's give them a 20% off store wide coupon. Provide an outline, once I approve it, you'll do it, right? So, in this case, because it's a quad project, I don't need to, uhm, I don't need to share the UDI link again. So, that's the link for opaline. Here's the link for sacred. Oh my god, I keep getting the wrong thing, sorry about that. Finally, let's do store wide. So, again, So let's run this prompt and see what we get. Alright, welcome, celebration, what to expect, good positioning, expectations, join community saving before tracking. We don't have a community, but I'll just keep it for now. You know, your ice cream has shipped. I think, what are we checking, I think these are timelines that are a little too fast. I'm going to have to give feedback here, it's just fine, okay? Uhm, let's move email to, to, what's this, for email to, for, let's say, you know, should you can assume, okay, for email three, make the code. Pitch 20, just because, this is not confusing, probably. For email four, it seems like going day five, a one-week check-in. Doesn't make sense, it's too early. Let's move that to email five, day ten, and move emails back correspondingly. Let's also do a new email four. That comes out on day five. Please provide suggestions. I think I like D. I like this for a shot. I think we should do an email one. I think I like option. D the most for email four. Let's go ahead and write this sequence, please. So what I want you to be seeing here is like, Some of everything else, like, you kind of are the commander, but you're more like a strategist than actually writing the copy, right? Like, And so you might look at this and say, well, I want them to be like every single day. You just tell Claude, hey, I want this to be every single day, Uhm. So it's really like as simple as that. I'll say, I'll share this conversation history. So you can see that the revisions, you know, day one, welcome instant gratification, a gratitude. My family, I want to personally welcome you to what I believe will be one of the most transformative skin care journeys you've ever experienced. You just made a beautiful choice, not just for yourself, but your skin, but for yourself. And this is by the way, this is not weird. Like Opal's thing Skin care. We're sort of very subtle with it. Uhm, but this is actually all good. I mean, the heart emoji thing is weird why it's gray. We'll want to do different emojis probably. So this is you made, so it's like really reaffirming their thing, right? Cleanse their face gently, right, tell them what to do, even the application, pro tips. I mean, I don't know if you should say less is more. It's fine, but I don't know if you really need it. Perfect partner. How to amplify your results. I guess this is going on day 3, I don't know if they would have it yet, so I would modify this copy. But again, it's not that the copy's bad, it's literally just being consistent and logical. I'm not sure why, it's being worth these hearts right now, right? Uhm, okay, go forward to day 5, I'm going to give you the spotlight. Right, Good to think of it, it's kind of reminding them how great the formula is that they bought. Get your one week check in, here's what people notice, you're not seeing dramatic changes, don't worry, it's normal, it has a good sign, you know, it is great. What happened, what's happening to your skin right now, you're way too focused, right? to these things. So it's kind of good consumption, right? Talking about this 20 day cycle, here's these great things that are happening. You know, it's giving homework, we don't have to do that, but I don't hate it honestly. Customer success spotlight, so anyway, it's pretty good overall, right? It's pretty cool. So, let me save that as well. I'll do, like, uh, new document, uh, Unity welcome series. It's cool, right? So now it's saying, okay, awesome job. Um, now I want to do a three-day sale for 4th of July for Opal Beauty. Let's make it, uh, let's, sorry, why? If they can save 30%, please provide an outline. Depends on your skin concern, it's just sort of mediocre. Okay, great, uhm, let's Thanks, but let's do three emails on day three. I know this is already the 4th of July, but like, Day three. I don't know how else to tell it. Uhm. So, what I'm gonna say is, like, uhm, get about our other two SKUs as well. And if I had taught it, I could have just told that in advance, right? Okay, great. Go ahead. Write it, please. You have to format it. I don't know why Claude is really being so bizarre with the, uh, The, uhm, I mean the formatting and also the emojis. You need to update pricing. Pricing is off on this. That's good, right? Like why, you know, true freedom comes from these things, right? So there might be little things you want to, like, modify, but overall, it should give you a pretty good place. And you saw, like, these samples, you should be thinking like a copywriter, marker, and thinking back to, like, what you're accomplishing. Yeah, should be pretty solid overall. And it's cool, like I said, you can do this with, uh, you know, I used Opal, but I'm trying to think of, like, I mean, I don't know, I don't feel like I need to beat you over the head with examples, but, like, you know, you saw the other examples for, like, coaching, info products, whatever it is, I mean, yeah, you can do it for, like, really whatever. So, uh, yeah, there you go. So this project should be, should have fun, should really help you a lot. Make life a lot easier, uhm, you just gotta, you know, just tell it what you want and give it feedback. Like, that's really the secret, you know? Oh, and by the way, what if I don't have a website, you know, like, I mean, fine, one more thing I want to show you real quick, uhm, I'm doing a new call, I think, right? like I'm trying to think of one of our examples, oh my gosh, that seduction thing, when I tried to show this person to one time Like, it literally was not, like, this is some old-ass thing from forever ago. I swear to God I don't, I'm not doing anything in the seduction space, it's so annoying What I'm thinking about is, like, what's a brief that we didn't use yet, like, financial? Financial is tricky, but we can test it We did, you know, Unity I don't think we have, we have the one blood sugar thing in there. I'm trying to think of a thing I could do where it's, like, not I don't want to basically skew the data because it's already got a blood sugar thing in. Oh, what the hell, let's go with, uh If I have a sales letter, That's what I should have done Well, that's fine, you can do a brief R sales letter, uh, for a financial, uh, newsletter product Please review, and then come up with a 7 email abandoned cart sequence Outline once approved, I'll have you write the sequence Try to bury this, be far more supportive of this nightmare Cure evolution, know where you'll profit from Restate the core hook, create urgency While you hesitate, billionaires double down Your $49 charter membership expires tomorrow That's good, yo, one thing I might do is be like, you know, offer them an extra 25% off starting on day 5 Yes, this looks good. Go ahead and write it, Okay, just to see. And again, I could upload a sales letter. I could do whatever. You know, I could link it to any website. I could, like, you know, like hotdogs.com or whatever. Uhm, so, it's pretty powerful and pretty versatile. But, you know. This is going to be kind of, you know, this is going to be kind of conspiratorial and whatever. This is going to match the style of the brief, right? So, anyway, this is pretty dope. And it already looks really good. I'll save this so you have access to that as well. And you have the cloud project, so you can create plenty yourself. And then you'll have the PDFs of all the sequences. This is in here too. Not received. Alright, thanks.

### Template 3: Template 3

Alright, so let's move on to welcome sequences here. You know, really, there's a lot of opportunities, you know, and a lot you can do, but I'm gonna keep this pretty high level, um, as far as, like, just what are the purposes, and then we'll look at examples, right? I mean, really, the purposes are just fourfold, right? Reaffirm their decision. You know, they just bought, so it's like, great job, that was smart, you're awesome, this is gonna be great. Um, I'm actually gonna change the order here, put this here. Like, kind of answer those vital questions of, like, you know, sort of reaffirming the decision, it's kind of related, but, like, your order's being shipped, you're gonna get it soon, here's what to expect, here's how you're gonna get the best results, right, so all those things are sort of answering the questions of, when am I gonna get my package, like, what should I do, right, you're gonna answer those things, but you're also reaffirming the decision, um, you know, you're establishing a relationship of building trust, whether that's coming from an individual or a brand or whatever, and then you want to turn a one-time customer into a repeat customer, typically. Yeah, I'll keep it at that. You know, an exception to that would be, like, the only exception there is if, you know, there's nothing else to sell them, so to speak, but even then you want to build a relationship. So, let's look at, uh, supplement13.com. I think I switched. This is still supplement13 for the weight loss one. And honestly, for this, I just took the same Welcome Sequence template that my wife, Laura, had done back in the day for ProfitFixFormula, and I applied it to this. You know, if you think this is a little bit too cheesy, you can always change it and inject a different personality into it, uhm, cause there's a lot of, it's a little bit of feminine energy, to be honest with you, but me. I mean, it still works, right, there's gonna be 15 emails in here, so I'm not gonna read through every single one, you can kind of read through them separately. This first email is basically like, you know, here's Sarah, the founder, right, and it's sort of like fun, you know, we got a new order, right, there's cheers and applause, we've lasted, Eye of the Tiger, you know, even Marcus, our master packer, smiled, and Marcus never smiles, everyone was thrilled you're now part of our family, thank you, you know, once we clean up our mess, Celebration Mess, we'll be working to get your order on its way to you, we're so excited for you to experience your transformation journey and finally work with your body instead of against it, you know, here's where our warehouse is, uh, we ship out orders every business day, which means yours will be on its way soon. You'll get a separate email with a tracking number, when your package arrives, it'll include this, right? Now, obviously, make sure it's true, uhm, and, you know, by the way, since you're a valued customer, we'll send you notifications of extra tips, success stories, new launches, members-only benefits, you can say customer-only benefits if you wanted, if you any questions, here's our customer service, thanks again, we're so excited, and then, by the way, here's a little disclaimer. Right, so, this is a classic, but a goodie, it works, right? It's like, okay, reaffirms your decision hard, answers some questions, where's the location, you know, when am I gonna get it, will I get a tracking number, like, things like that, builds trust, establishes a relationship, and gives them an opportunity to become a repeat customer right away. Okay, six hours later, even though, they've already bought, this is an optional thing you could do, but it's not bad, gives them a personal message, like a little video, kind of educating them, helps with consumption, uhm, connects the face to the brand, this is a great little thing to do to build that trust. Personal relationship, so it's like, you know, oh, I forgot to send this, here's a video from me, or from someone from our company, right, next day, come see it's true, member perks, again, I don't know if I would do members, I'd be careful, because of subscription wear out, you know, we know how much you're going to love Vital Burn Pro, and we want to give you a quick 50% member discount code that no one else has, so you can pick up any additional wellness products on sale, and stack up on your journey. Okay, this is a little bit generic, maybe you'd say whatever your thing is, um, just use this code, and watch 50% off the total, so it's fast, but hey, you're feeling good about your purchase, you like the stuff we sent already, well guess what, you can go buy more and save 15%. Okay, this one's an unboxing one, again, all up to you, you don't have to do all of these, but I like, they're great. I'm really excited, you know, you're gonna have great, here's what's gonna be in your box, it shows you everything you enjoy, um, and also, you know, in this case, the video also shows other products, so they might buy more stuff, um, but again, what are these emails doing? Referring to the decision, they're answering vital questions, establishing a relationship, they're really doing all of these things, like, Laura did a great job with these emails. Okay, so that's their package, alright, hey, you know, your package is here, um, and if it's not, it'll be here soon, because what if it doesn't arrive? You know, reminding them what a great decision they made, if you have questions, let us know. Check your door for a package like this, you know, so link to, like, additional products here. Hey, take some before and after measurements, you know, track your success, because I'm so confident you're going to have success, right? Email six, special member offer, yeah, I might do, like, new customer offer, private discount, Oh my gosh, sorry. Code, use this. Member coupon code, right, and be careful of member, again, because if it's not a subscription, people might be a little wary. But it's like, you're just, it's pretty straight forward, hey, go here, use this code, get new stuff. When we check in a notification about you, like a message about you, your name come up on my phone, Hey, you know, it's been a week since you got your, uh, order. Or, since you ordered, again, maybe you time this one to see, like, depending on when they're going to get their product, you don't want to send this out and they haven't gotten their product yet, right, use common sense. Um, I'm excited for you to be experiencing your journey, in just one week, you should start noticing, like, here's what's coming, right, use it, consume it, consumption is important, right, too. Um, and it'll be, keep feeling so excited, so good, so good as you stick with your routine, oh, well, like, because consistency is so important, here's 10% off your next order, click here for your own private discount, use this to stack up like Maria did, a little testimonial, it's good for 24 hours. Next day, hey, remember I sent you this coupon, sticking with it is good, right, like, the longer you use it, the more results you get, here's this coupon, don't forget it, one last chance. Uhm, hey, I'm gonna let you get 20% off, it says next day each time, but really, I'd probably put like. I mean, technically you're going longer than 24 hours of this, but that's probably okay. This is like, yeah, by the way, here's what some of the most popular things are. One nice thing, this is two weeks later, survey them. Help us, you know, get even better at bringing real transformations to people, quickly. Put it here, right, I'll give you a reward, and the reward could be like a discount code, right? So at this point we go to weekly, because we've sort of emailed them a lot. You can do whatever, you can, you can keep emailing every day. Uhm, but this is sort of to give you like a template or something you could be using. Uhm, here's some more coupon codes, here's like a restock for the welcome sequence, even though we do have a different restock sequence in this, uh, we'll be sharing here. Right? Trying to get testimonials, after five weeks. This is a good one, right, another little sneaky coupon, oh, some people missed out on our last promotion, we feel so bad about that, people are going to get results. Here, use this coupon. And you can do the adverse through, hey, you know, it's been eight weeks, or however long since you started using it, uhm, you know, don't forget to keep using the product, here's your anniversary coupon, right, this is really, it's pretty smart too. So, it's a nice sequence, right, let me show you another example. In this case, that Airbnb asset control method, but in this case I decided, as well, let's make it a $97 course, and we want to sell them on the strategy session, you know, booking, right. So, welcome, you know, hey, I'm Mac, like, I want to welcome you to the most important investment you've ever made in your financial future, course is ready and waiting, here's how you log in, start here tonight, I might say, like, just start here, immediately, log in, go to module 1, you know, here's a train, this is what it's going to do, watch it, it's the foundation of everything else, builds on, as soon as it tells me it's the moment everything clicks, let's go to next, I'll send you a complete course roadmap, you'll get your market research assignment, we'll guide you step by step to your first deal opportunity, you know, save this email, uhm, you did a great job, start with module 1, Make sure you join our Facebook group, right, so why is this good, well, what's it doing, okay, personal relationship, reaffirms the decision, you know, I guess one thing I could add here, is encouraging consumption, right, Consume the content, use it, especially for a lot of things, it's like, a lot of people, even for, especially on bizop, you know, for all the shit bizop people get, a lot of them have, like, really good stuff, a lot of them don't, but many people do, and, like, the problem is people don't consume it, right, so, get them using stuff, and by the way, if they use stuff, they're more likely, and by the way, consumption can also be for supplements, but if they use stuff, they're more likely to keep using it, keep buying, keep ordering, all of that, right, so you go to your course roadmap, you know, hope you watched module one, here's what your next 30 days look like, right, so this is sort of breaking down, again, for a hypothetical course, here's an assignment, right, it's giving an actual assignment, I don't know if this is a real thing, right, but basically it's telling people what to do, a timeline to get results, all of that, right, this is all really, like, good, because it's sort of, like, reaffirming their decision, hallowing your results, it's sort of answering that, you know, building trust, hey, I'm really helping you, uhm, encouraging consumption, everything there, you know, and the Facebook community too, which is, which is solid, because it's more sticky, right, people go to a Facebook group, they're more likely to kind of stick with it, okay, now you're going to, like, want to fast track results. You know, how's progress been, here's what I've noticed after working with 300 students, the course is great, but here's the thing, knowledge alone, might say isn't enough, right, the difference between my students, the difference between my students is going the first property deal in 30 days versus those that take 6 months usually comes down to one thing, having a personalized roadmap for their situation, uhm. I'd be careful with this, I'm probably going to delete this. Why am I going to delete this? Because course teaches the general method, but every market is different, so every situation is different, blah, blah. Every student's discount, you know, situation is unique, every person's goals and timelines are specific to them, that's why after saying most course careers don't, free asset control strategy sessions where I personalize your specific market and create a customized roadmap for your success. On this call, as we dive deep into the best neighbor in your area, you know, optimal property, blah, blah, blah. These sessions simply run $500, but they're completely free for core students, people who, uh, I've learned that students who personalize roadmaps succeed 3x faster than those trying to figure out a loan, I want to fast track results, these are limited so there's some scarcity and urgency, uhm, I don't know if you use PS or not, because you don't really say I'm trying to sell you something, but they probably know, right? But it's questionable. Okay, student success stories, right? So that's sort of like, hey, believability. So now we're kind of going to selling. So there's sort of some of those more elements when you go into the selling aspect of something where it's like, because in this case, it's like if you're, if you're ascension, if you're an ascension model, where it was like, you know, $47 course, $27 course, $97 course, and then you're moving them to a book a call and book a call to like becoming that paying customer, right? Then it's like, okay, great. But you almost have to resell them on things and answer some objections as you would for an abandoned or anybody else. So you're sharing success stories, right? People use this roadmap. They got great results. You know, you can get the same thing, book it here. Okay. First week action plan. So it's kind of nice, right? Here's what you should accomplish in your first week. So this is kind of good because it's like, hey, I'm checking in on you, right? But hey, maybe you're overthinking things. Maybe you're feeling stuck, right? No problem. That's where I give this session called book it. Why most people fail. So it's gonna get a little more harsh, right? Hey, course buyers. I mean, this is optional. Depending on what you're trying to do with that experience. My dog is just like, it's making it really hard to work. Um, you know. You know, this will be effective. It's a little bit of a strong sale. So, you know, you can kind of decide, you know, again, this is sort of a template for someone who's doing this model, right? And, and so, so share that, um. You know, really detailed breakdown of the strategy, session call here, behind the scenes story, right? Somebody who is going to go on the same journey I want you to go on. They bought the course, they had the call, we did the strategy session, we identified the stuff, they implemented it, right? This is, wow, this is really real. This isn't just a bullshit call. I'm really going to, like, you know, see a path to, like, having success here. There's another angle, another reason why. Alright, limited spots, okay, sessions are filling up. Now we're going to kind of hit them with scarcity, urgency. Come on, let's go, final 48 hours. I'm going to go fast here, doors closing. Closes tonight. The end, right? The last sequence I'm going to go through really fast. This is for someone who bought the high-ticket coaching, and this one's really just all about consumption. Reaffirm what they did, establish a relationship, consumption, consumption, consumption, right? Gives them assignments, mindset. So I'm not going to read through all this one, but this is really just like, This is really just a whole consumption sequence. This gives me something to consume, of course. So, uhm. This is obviously for a made-up course, but this is really nice. You can take this, do it for your course, program, coaching thing, whatever, or your clients, and use that. Alright, so, that's gonna finish up welcome sequences, and then we've got promotional sales and win-back sales, or win-back, uh, and reorder sequences, and they'll be, I think, in pretty good shape on the email side at that point.
