### Armadilha 1: [Nome do erro]
**O que acontece**: Hello again. All right, so in this video we're going to be looking at that same mechanism generation process we did previously, but for the peptide space. So the kind of UMP idea generation, and then we will save unique mechanisms that we like, have different LLMs evaluate them. And kind of decide which one to go for. So the same thing we did with, uh, the Airbnb example, okay? So, same kind of prompt, right? Today I want your help coming up with this many unique mechanism ideas for a product in the skincare space. Uhm, I'm going to say, you know, as possible for a product. Specific product is a peptide ice cream. I've attached a research brief, right? That's your universal research document, or we called it, uhm, expression mechanism. For this exercise, let's specifically focus on people in the market who are solution aware. So if you go back to the product market awareness thing that I just keep talking about, uhm, you know, we kind of had agreed that for this market, I'll show you, pretty much the way I viewed it, especially everyone who is problem aware is also solution aware, right? Uhm, like this is kind of like the way Gemini did this here is like where they fall into like the mix. but essentially, If you're solution aware, then you're also problem aware, obviously, right? And a lot of them are also product aware and most aware, but, you know, in our case, solution aware was looking for eye creams, all that kind of stuff, not specifically looking for peptide stuff. It's probably what the biggest segment is, makes the most sense to go for them, that's why we are going for that demo, right? Uhm, sorry, I don't know what the hell I have going on there. So, the other thing I did though, if I'm doing this for a supplement, or in this case a skin care eye cream, additionally I have included a list of product ingredients for your consideration. Here is the list, right? Go ahead and get started now. So, I did this in a few different places. I did it with, um, sorry, let's see what's in there. First I did it with Gemini Deep Research. And, spoiler, it again was definitely my favorite, but I'll show you in several LMs. I am not, for this one, going to read through all of its sort of preamble. Like I did in Airbnb Arbitrage, watch that one if you want to kind of see that entire journey with me. While this is a summary of things that we've found out through research, through psychographic research, comparative research, problem market, market, you know, product awareness research, all of that. Okay, so I'm kind of skipping through all this to where it starts giving me specific mechanism concepts, okay? Uhm, so let's get to those. Section 2, unique mechanism concept 1, the dermal disarray realignment. Now, you may say, cool, or you may say, dermal disarray realignment, that sounds kind of made up. I don't know about that. That's how I feel. When I personally look at it, I'm like, dermal disarray realignment. However, we're not idiots. So, because we're not idiots, we can, we have the power to abstract out and go, maybe the mechanism is still good, and the name they gave it is just bad, right? And because we're not, we're all smart people here, we're not gonna just sort of dismiss this because we're because of the name, because guess what, we could always change the name. And I don't mean that to be like, it came out more cynical sounding than I meant for it to, it just is a pet peeve of mine, I think, where someone, oh, I don't like that name, now I'm dismissive about it, right? It's like, well, let's see what they have to say. Okay, the problem. Dermal disarray, the hidden structural chaos. For years, the prevailing narrative sold to this consumer has been one of simple collage and logic. She has been told that her skin is wrinkling and losing firmness because this crucial protein is depleting with age. This explanation, however, is incomplete and fails to account for why the numerous collagen boosting products she has tried have proven inadequate. The real, more insidious problem is not just loss, but disorganization. The underlying issue is a state of dermal disarray, where her existing collagen fibers have become tangled, weakened, and chaotic. Instead of a strong, tightly woven mesh providing firm support, her dermal structure has devolved into a disorganized tangle. This structural chaos is what allows the skin to fold into permanent wrinkles and loses youthful tautness. This can be visualized using the analogy of a tent. Her previous solutions were like trying to patch small holes in the tent's fabric, addressing collagen loss, but the real problem is that the tent poles have collapsed and become jumbled, dermal disarray. No matter how perfectly the fabric is patched, the tent has no structure and cannot stand firm. The feeling of skin losing its snap and lines becoming permanently etched is far better described by this kind of catastrophic structural failure than by simple depletion. By defining the problem as dermal disarray, we create a new knowledge gap and position our solution as uniquely equipped to address this previously undiagnosed issue. The solution, UMS, the biome is called the biotensegrity signal in smart materials. The solution to dermal disarray is not to crudely attempt to pump more material into a collapsed structure, but to restore its architectural integrity. This is achieved through a two-part system that reestablishes order and provides the precise materials for reconstruction. The biotensegrity signal, dipalmetol hydroxyproline, the primary The primary dipalmetol hydroxyproline, is introduced not as a generic peptide, but as a biotensegrity signaling molecule. Its specific function is to command the skin's own machinery to correct the chaos. It works by stimulating the contraction of existing collagen fibers, effectively pulling the tangled network taut and restoring its organized, strong, and resilient structure. This process activates, effectively firms the tissues and helps optimize the arrangement of collagen fibers. To ensure this critical signal reaches its target, DPHP is chemically modified with palmic acid, a fatty acid that increases its lithiolic, uh, lipophilicity, allowing it to penetrate the skin's lipid layers and work deep within the dermis where the disarray exists. The smart material is amino acids. Once the managed rebuild has been issued, the skin needs the right building blocks on site. We've got these amino acids. There's a protective shield with DHPH, which also acts as a guardian. Okay? So what do I think of this mechanism? Eh. It's okay. It's save it. It's good enough that you could use different names. You could put it into Claude or someone, and say, hey, I know Yo, here's a mechanism for this eye serum. I think it's a little confusing. How could we simplify it? What are three different ways we could explain this using different metaphors and analogies? Three different ways we could explain this To somebody right like essentially maybe said that different way this makes sense as it sounds it feels a little bit technical so while I'm going to Save it. It is not my it's just a lot of kind of the biotensegrity all these sorts of things It's a lot right doesn't mean It couldn't be saying that makes sense So we put it into our little document where we take the example just like the last thing we take mechanism Outputs we like we're gonna put it here, okay The crack dehydration debt in the hydromagnetic wall So again, I'm just gonna say as a universal I wouldn't worry about nicknames always sometimes they're great Like I really like some of them for Airbnb Sometimes it may not be great, but we can change the names, right? That's not the end of the road Okay, the problem chronic dehydration debt a crisis of retention a tight papery and creepy creepy texture that plagues the delicate under-eye skin Is not simply dryness. It is a symptom of a much deeper more persistent issue chronic dehydration debt Over years hormonal shifts particularly during perimenopause and menopause and cumulative environmental damage have systematically destroyed the skin's natural moisture anchors the carbohydrate complexes within the stratum perineum that are part of the natural moisturizing factor NMF I do like moisture anchors. I think that's an interesting Concept so note that right now. I like moisture anchors This explains why standard hydrators including the widely touted hyaluronic acid have provided only fleeting relief. These ingredients act like a temporary cash infusion for a business with no bank account. They draw moisture to the skin's surface creating a temporary plumping effect. However, because the skin's moisture anchors are broken, this water cannot be held. It quickly evaporates into the atmosphere through a process called transepidermal water loss leaving the skin just as dehydrated or even more so. A few hours later, a few hours later. In low humidity environments, standard hyaluronic acid can even accelerate this step by pulling moisture from the deeper levels of the skin up to the surface where it is then lost. The cycle of temporary hydration followed by rapid evaporation perfectly explains the trial and error exhaustion with moisturizers that promise much but deliver little lasting effect. The solution. The hydromagnetic lock system. To truly solve the chronic dehydration debt, the skin needs more than just a temporary infusion of water. It needs a fundamental ability to retain water restored. This is accomplished with a sophisticated two-level hydration system that both locks in moisture at the surface and replenishes it from deep within. The lock, saccharide isomerate. The revolutionary ingredient saccharide isomerate is positioned as the hydromagnetic lock. This plant-derived carbohydrate complex has a unique molecular structure that makes the skin's own NMF, both a crucial component to the It forms a powerful covalent bond with the keratin in the skin's outermost layer. This bond is so strong that it acts like a magnet for water, and critically, it cannot be washed away. By attaching itself to the skin, saccharide isomerate creates a long-lasting moisture reservoir that delivers continuous hydration for up to 72 hours. It doesn't just add water, it fundamentally restores the skin's ability to hold onto it, effectively reinstalling the moisture anchors that were lost. Poot too, paying the deep debts. Working in perfect synergy with the surface lock is sodium hyaluronate. While often marketed interchangeably with hyaluronic acid, it possesses a key structural advantage, a much smaller molecular size. This smaller size allows it to penetrate through the skin barrier and reach the deep layers of the dermis, something standard high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid cannot do. While saccharide isomerate is locking down the surface, sodium hyaluronate, Oh my god, I can't talk. ,sodium hyaluronate is traveling deep to replenish the depleted hydration reserves from within, effectively paying off the debt at its source. This two-pronged approach creates a complete hydration solution that is logically superior to anything she has tried before. It addresses both the symptom, surface dryness, and the root cause, an ability to retain water, ensuring both immediate visual plumping and deep long-term restoration of the skin's hydration system. Alright, so what about this one? I like it. Uhm, again, I don't necessarily love the names. I like the idea of moisture anchors a lot. I wonder about the sort of specific issues of fine lines, wrinkles, those sorts of things. Like, I think this is good for hydration and glowing skin. I don't know that it really addresses some of those deeper problems or pain points. So, uhm. I like it. Those are my objections. I'm going to add this one to our list. And, we're going to keep going. Alright, next up. The Elastase Cascade Neutralizer. Again, these names are not good for actual copy. Like, imagine, why are they not good? Think about it. If you're talking to, like, your mom or your wife. Or a woman in that age range. By that age range, really anything. Like, 30 to 80. Someone's like, oh yeah, it's an Elastase, uhm, Elastase Cascade Neutralizer. You're like, what the f*** are you talking about, right? So, the names aren't good. But, that's okay. For us, internally, fine. The problem. The Elastase Cascade, the Invisible Thief of Firmness. The appearance of crow's feet and the loss of firmness around the eyes are often presented as a passive effect. The Elastase Cascade is a relentless, invisible process where this enzyme systematically seeks out and severs the skin's elastin fibers. The protein network's responsible for the skin's elasticity and snapback quality. Every time the last one is broken, the skin's ability to rebound from exposure is is diminished, allowing fine lines to become permanently etched into the skin. Most firming creams fail because they focus exclusively on building collagen while completely ignoring the active demolition of the elastin network. This is akin to hiring a construction crew to build a house while a demolition team is still actively working on the site, and new structures are composed- are compromised before they are even completed. This explains why results from many firming products are minimal, temporary, or non-existent, and why her skin continues to lose its resilience despite her best efforts. By naming this specific enzymatic enemy, we create a new knowledge gap and reduce the problem that her previous products were not designed to fight. The solution, the elast- elastin-guardian complex. Uhm, so we need to basically guard against elastin loss. Okay. I think, again, frankly, okay. Not mind-blowing, but okay. Alright, next one. The oxidative depletion loop, when defenses fail. The consumer is familiar with the concept of free radical damage, however the generic term fails to capture the systemic crisis occurring in her skin. The real problem is a self-perpetuating downward spiral. called the oxidative depletion loop. This would be the name I like the most so far, because it sounds like the most believable. The loop begins when the skin's natural antioxidant defenses become overwhelmed by the constant onslaught of environmental aggressors like UV radiation and pollution. Each time an antioxidant molecule, such as vitamin E, neutralizes the damaging free radical, the antioxidant molecule becomes spent or oxidized, rendering it useless. In youthful, healthy skin, these spent antioxidants are quickly replaced and quickly regenerate, however in skin over 40, the regeneration system slows down and the defense becomes progressively depleted. This creates a vicious cycle. Fewer active antioxidants lead to more unrepaired damage, which in turn creates more free radicals, further depleting the already weakened defenses. This is the oxidative depletion loop, and it manifests virtually as stubborn dark circles, a dull, lifeless complexion, and perpetually tired look that doesn't match how she feels inside. This explains why simply applying a single antioxidant like basic vitamin C or vitamin E cream has not been enough. This product is for a temporary supply of soldiers, but do nothing to fix the broken supply chain, ultimately failing to break the cycle. Solution, the antioxidant regeneration engine. I don't like that name. The only way to break the oxidative depletion loop is to install a system that doesn't just supply antioxidants, but actively regenerates them. Solution is a powerful, synergistic combination of vitamin C and vitamin E, which function together as an antioxidant regeneration engine. I'm just like, I'm gonna actually skip this one. The reason I'm not gonna do it is because I don't think vitamin E and vitamin C are exciting enough for a skincare product, right? I think we need more exotic or unique ingredients like than vitamin E, vitamin C, which while popular are pretty well known. And I don't think that they're the heroes or stars of our formulation. All right, what about the lipid barrier breach and inflammaging, okay? This mechanism focuses on the skin's most fundamental point of failure, its first line of defense. The problem is the lipid barrier breach. The skin's protective outer layer, the stratum corneum, can be visualized as a brick and mortar wall. The skin cells are the bricks, the lipids are surrounding them are the mortar. With age, hormonal changes, and environmental stress, the lipid mortar begins to degrade, developing microscopic cracks and gaps. This breach also has two devastating consequences that are directly mapped to consumers' frustrations. Uncontrolled moisture loss, the cracks in the barrier act like an open window, allowing the skin's precious moisture to escape unchecked. This leads to the chronic dryness, tightness, and flakiness she experiences. To get away, the inflammaging, more insensitive continuously. The breach creates an open door for external irritants, pollutants, and allergens to penetrate deep into the skin. This constant influx of foreign invaders triggers the immune system, creating a state of persistent, low-grade inflammation. Scientists have given this phenomenon a new name, inflammaging, but I'm like, whatever, to be honest with you. The solution is a biomimetic seal. Basically, patch cracks restore the barrier's integrity. I mean, I like the idea of a biomimetic barrier seal. I don't really like the first part of it, but because I like the idea of a seal, I'm gonna go ahead and save this one. You know what else I'm gonna do? Just, uh, go here. Okay, that has a little summary here, okay? So, one thing, this is a case where I'm gonna just test for perplex- I have a bunch of other mechanisms too, but I'm gonna test for perplexity's deep research. I'm gonna upload a PDF. It should be asking me questions, so let's just see here. I'm gonna let it run in the background while we go to the next one. Okay, so I ran the perplexity one. You want to see that one now? Why not? Let's look at perplexity now, okay? Let's see if there are any gaps. Okay, number one. The preorbital collagen depletion mechanism. Most eye creams fail because they only address surface symptoms while ignoring the, oh sorry, periorbital area loss, er, that the periorbital area loses collagen at 3x the rate of other facial zones due to its uniquely thin skin structure and constant moving, creating a collagen desert with the Standard Board of Restorators Camp Pantry. Our dipalmetol hydroxyproline works as a collagen preservation shield that not only stimulates new collagen synthesis but uniquely preserves existing collagen by inhibiting the special elastase enzymes that break down collagen in the eye area, creating a dual action approach that both builds and protects. So while it's not as eloquently written as Gemini's deep research. I actually like that and part of it is because, you know, I think elastase is a worthwhile thing to talk about in addition to collagen, but it's much more simplified. I think this is like things that are, like, my one concern with the way Gemini framed some of those ICER mechanisms we looked at is that perhaps it's a little bit over complicated, right? Uhm, and it's funny because I feel like the over complicating worked well for Airbnb arbitrage, but I don't know that I like the over complicating for saying, like, skincare, where women just kind of want to know what's going on. because, They're already product aware, right? Or they're, they're like, solution aware, and a lot of them, sorry, they're already solution aware at a high level. So, they just sort of want more of the facts. We saw that in our psychographic research and things too, right? They research, but they kind of don't want complicated things and all this, right? The Airbnb arbitrage one we looked at, it's like, people who are just sort of problem aware, and could even be kind of unaware. We're talking to more about broader level about income and essentially just like, hey, stop trading time for money, right? Biz op mechanisms are usually pretty simple, but people make them, part of the trick is making them seem more complex and sophisticated and all that. Right now, for better or worse, don't shoot the messenger, right? Uhm, and so, actually, you know, like simpler things for health and wellness, and in general you should too. I see this very often where I think people just really overcomplicate the mechanisms, and And I really, I think I've gotten to a place now for health, beauty, things of that nature. where you typically see these simpler mechanisms win more often. So, I actually like that one. Even though it's really simple, probably my favorite so far. We'll just be curious to see what the other LLMs say when we evaluate. Okay, cellular communication breakdown. The real reason iRequests persist is that aging skin cells around the eyes lose their ability to communicate with each other after 40, creating a cellular signaling breakdown where even healthy cells can't coordinate repair processes, making standard anti-aging ingredients effective. Our peptide complex functions as cellular signal restorers that re-establish the critical communication pathways between skin cells, allowing them to synchronize to repair activities and work together again, similar to how a conductor coordinates an orchestra. This seems like, to be honest with you, a mediocre mechanism that I would see in CA Pro from, like, one of the copywriters of a business owner in it, and be like, I have no idea if it's gonna work or not. My gut on why I don't like this and I'm not gonna add it to my sheet would be I don't think it's a great mechanism. The reason I don't think it's a great mechanism is I think this idea of, like, cellular communication inherently becomes more and more complicated. Inherently, you're making more of a leap, right? It's like, you've got these cells, the cells are communicating, the communications are scrambled, the scrambling, it's like, there's a lot of shit in there that I need to sort of, like, conceptualize, believe is true, that I can't really conceptualize, sometimes my cell is communicating, the communication to being jammed, whatever it is, right? Versus the error. The area around your eyes loses collagen three times faster than other areas of your face due to its unique structure, in fact, it creates what's called a collagen desert, and it can't be penetrated by standard moisturizers, right? This peptide works as a, basically, collagen, I don't know if I would use a preservation shield, but for now, right? It not only stimulates new collagen synthesis, so you're rebuilding collagen, or creating new collagen, but preserves existing collagen by inhibiting or stopping, uhm, these enzymes that would normally break down collagen in the eye area, so it's basically this dual-action approach that both builds and protects around your skin, right? And obviously, we'd make this much more in-depth, which we know for the Quad Project and ability to do, but that to me is easy to understand, this one is less easy to understand. The Dermal-Epidermal Junction Collapse Mechanism. Enough, I mean, this is basically what our mechanism is for OPAL. I wonder if it's citing us. That's funny, right? That is our current one, but it'll be fun as a test. We'll add this one in, okay? Traditional eye creams fail because they don't address the critical structural collapse of the dermal-epidermal junction, the architectural foundation between skin layers that flattens with age, causing the eye area to lose its structural integrity and create a perforated skin. Permanent state of skin lax- laxity, peptide formation contains junction rebuilders that target and reinforce this crucial skin foundation, rebuilding the wave-like structure of the DAG to restore the architectural support systems that keep eye skin firm and resilient. So I'm like, biased, but, you know, I like, obviously like this one, uh, I did it before. I guess I'll do the header so it's more consistent. Yeah, this is like, basically, obviously much more depth, but like, what our actual mechanism is currently, right? The periorbital skin suffers from a circadian rhythm dysfunction where the natural 24-hour repair cycle of skin cells becomes desynchronized after 40, preventing proper nighttime regeneration, causing x-rayed aging around the eyes. Our proprietary serum contains chronobiology regulators that resynchronize the skin's natural repair clock. Uh, this one, I actually don't hate, like, as far as, like, if you were doing, like, a nighttime eye serum, but it also is kind of bullshit, we don't have a chronobiology regulator, like, you know, fine, and you still have to make a mental leap to the idea of, like, you know, the circadian rhythm, your, the skin has a special 24-hour rhythm that gets thrown off, like, more of a cognitive leap has to happen. So I'm out. Okay, quackation damage. Quackation damage, where the hidden cause of stubborn eye wrinkles is quackation damage, where sugar molecules in the bloodstream attach to collagen proteins around the eyes, creating harmful advanced quackation end products that stiffen and distort collagen, making it impossible for conventional moisturizers to restore elasticity. Our formula contains anti-glycation peptide technology with dipolymethyl hydroxyproline that specifically targets and breaks the damage, damaging sugar protein structure. Deaging bonds while protecting new collagen from quackation, effectively de-aging the collagen matrix around the eyes. People use AGEs a lot, my knowledge about it is like, it's sort of 50-50 about if there's a big winner there, but I actually think it's a decent mechanism, it goes on the list. Why is it a decent mechanism? Um, this idea of sugars attaching to proteins that sort of like destroy collagen, and like, sugar in your blood is sort of known to be a bad thing, the idea of sugar in your blood is like, destroying collagen and elasticity, people think about sugar and inflammation, this thing basically stops the sugar-protein bonds, right? Is there actually some science to back that up? Possibly. Um. The idea of like a periorbital microbiome here, is a protective ecosystem of beneficial bacteria that maintains, uh, skin health around the eyes, but becomes imbalanced with age and harsh products. That's interesting. I think this is what I would call a big swing, right? Basically, Talking about, like, a, people know about the microbiome, like the ecosystem of bacteria in your gut. We know it's been proven to work in your gut, because it's, you know, what is going on in your gut. It's also worked in dental offers, for like, the ClickBank world, of like, they're sort of, Bad bacteria, good bacteria, bad bacteria is taken over in your mouth, right? We do know that sort of probiotic, Probiotics for skincare is a category, well, I know, that, uh, works, uhm. We don't have a probiotic-heavy formula, so I don't think this is my winner, but it's not a bad idea. We're saving, right? So, we'll pop it here. And I want to know. As annoying as it is to do. How many more are there? Oh my gosh, a lot more, right? This is sort of why you really need to be LLM agnostic, and ideally you're running these prompts on multiple LLMs. I see it all the time on, like, Twitter or other places, where people will go, which one is better? Cloud is better now, I'm cancelling ChatGPT, and it, like, literally does not compute for me. Like, I get it if you are just super broke, and you're like, man, I, you know, like, this is a huge thing for me. Like, I would cancel Netflix before I'd cancel, like, one of my LLM subscriptions. I would, because Netflix isn't going to make me money. This is. I would cancel, you know, Hulu. I would cancel a lot of things. Uhm, I just don't, get it, to be honest with you. Uhm, you're just thinking of it in, like, a really linear way. If, if you think that way, you really need to try to rewire your brain to think that there's just, like, you can, like, you're, that you can just use one LLM. You, you need to use several, okay? Uhm, okay. The stress hormone accumulation mechanism, the real reason iBags are in dark circles for cysts is cortisol accumulation because chronically, it's chronically elevated in the delicate eye area after 40, causing fluid retention, capillary fragility, and collagen breakdown that standard eye creams can't address. I don't know if this is true, this is actually very interesting. Peptide complex acts as a cortisol buffer that intercepts and neutralizes excess cortisol molecules before they can damage the eye area while simultaneously strengthening capillary walls to prevent the leakage that causes dark circles and puffiness. It's actually very interesting. I, again, might shy away from it. I kind of like my mechanisms more on the nose. If you go back to the DEJ one, it's very physiological. It's like, there's this, like, connection point between layers of your skin, it separates as it separates from your face. A cavern ensues. When a cavern, a hole, like a vacuum gets filled, right? In this case, skin sinks in, wrinkles appear, puffiness, like, or bags, right? Like, all that kind of stuff. Like, the other part's coming up. It's like erupting, like, fault lines, like an earthquake plate's coming up. Like, it's a very, I still think we could honestly explain it better on our PVP, our product page, but I really like that mechanism of the way we have it. Um, and in fact, what I might do for fairness is I might take the version of it from our website and put that version in instead of the version that came up for perplexity to see, right? I like all of that, and then the other one about just sort of causing loss to happen to 3x faster, whatever the other stuff was, was like number one, right? And there's a collagen desert. It's very simple, but I like that. So I like cortisol because women are all very aware of cortisol. Hormonal stuff is popular. It's very interesting. I don't rank it as, like, the strongest one, though, um, because it's less physiological and it's more with this other hormone. And I think it works pretty hormonal stuff works really well, but I don't know that it works really well for, like, skin care. Okay. I mean, it can, I don't know. It just, I, I think it's, it's more, again, I want as few cognitive leaps as possible. I want stuff they kind of know is true. And here's the one thing you were missing. Okay. The cellular water channel dysfunction mechanism. Traditional eye service failed because they don't address the, Aquaporin dysfunction where the microscopic water channels and skin cells aquaporins become damaged with age, preventing proper hydration from reaching the deeper layers of the eye area and creating dehydration from within our saccharate isomerate functions as aquaporin channel restores that repair and optimize these critical cellular water pathways, allowing moisture to properly flow between skin cells again and creating deep, lasting hydration that surface moisturizers can achieve. This one kind of has the same thing with those hydration anchors or moisture anchors or whatever. I actually like it a lot. I like this idea of, like, these microscopic water channels where your skin are damaged and basically hydration can't reach the deeper layers. We would need to tie it into wrinkles and dark circles and things of that nature. But, this is actually one of my ones I like a lot, uh, that, one of my preferred ones of what we've gone over so far. Okay, I know we've got a lot, but by the way, people talk about having trouble finding ideas for unique mechanisms. I don't think you can credibly talk about that anymore. Okay, mitochondrial energy crisis, uhm, this is gonna basically be mitochondria, the power cells in your eyes produce less energy after 40, means your eye cells aren't fueled. Mitochondrias are having a moment, the idea of, like, mitochondrial things. I don't like this one the most. I've never loved mitochondria mechanisms, but they do work sometimes, so we're gonna add it to our list as well. I know I'm glancing over this one, but there's like a billion, you know what I mean, so. Because they don't address periorbital lymphatic congestion, where the microscopic drainage channels around the eyes become sluggish with age, trapping toxins in fluid that creates puffiness in dark circles that topical caffeine can only temporarily mask. Our peptide formulation contains lymphatic flow enhancers. Do we have this ingredient? I don't think we actually have this ingredient, so So, I'm going to skip this one since we don't actually have that in here. Uhm, this one is interesting. I will, I will credit Increasingly impermeable after 40, impermeable means hard to penetrate, right, uh, preventing even high quality peptides from reaching their cellular targets and rendering them ineffective regardless of their concentration. Our formula utilizes biomimetic delivery technology with amino acids, proline, glycine, and alanine that mimic the skin's natural structure, allowing our peptides to bypass the barrier through cellular recognition and achieve 3X greater penetration to their target sites. So there's some questions there. There's a the validity of that, but I don't hate that. It's kind of, it's an easy, why do I actually, I mean, I kind of like it, why do I kind of like it, uhm, because the reason these things don't work now like they did when you were younger is because your skin's actually It's almost like a paradox, I would, you'd have to go deeper, like, there's a weird paradox, right, your skin's thinner, but it's actually harder to penetrate, and so a lot of stuff just, even though it didn't use to sit on the top, it does now, and the problem is most moisturizers, other things aren't going to do it, right, ours is different, why is ours just different? Well, we basically have these special amino acids that can mimic the skin's natural structure and allow our peptide to bypass the barrier through cellular recognition to get through your skin. What I would change with this is the reason most eye serums, instead of peptides, and this is a tiny thing, uhm, high quality, uhm, you know, formulas, I'm going to put high quality ingredients, like that, because I want to talk to problem aware Take And solution aware people, but not necessarily product aware people, right? Okay, last one, the collagen fiber disorganization, disorganization mechanism Sort of tangled collagen fibers, uhm, we had that from Gemini as well, so, cool, I'm going to skip it, because we already sort of have it once Now, I'm not going to go through, I'm going to, you know, require some time. I did chat GPT-03 Pro without deep research, it gave mechanisms, but to be honest with you, it was sort of like whatever, I didn't think it was great Uhm, not just the nicknames, but it's sort of like whatever, like, there's ideas, it'd be worth reading if I was, you know, going to write this right now, I would still read through it and save ideas Uhm, but I needed, I did chat GPT, deep research here, they had, uhm, kind of the same issue I mentioned with the Airbnb arbitrage, it's sort of like trying to do nicknames to explain really basic. physiological processes. It's not, like, actually going deep into, like, the real reasons, right? So, again, if I was, you know, there's nothing, it's not bad, but I'm just not so in love with these and I need to do it. This was Gemini 2.5 Pro, not deep research, hormonal cliff and scaffolding damage, zombie cells, glycation stiffening, we kind of talked about that one from perplexity. This idea of, like, a barrier breach, the skin under your eyes is thin, the skin under your body is bleached, indeficient moisture barrier, you have cracks, moisture evaporates, so we kind of saw things like that already. And I asked Claude, Claude did okay, but honestly, just had to trust my, trust me that, uhm, they weren't that good either, right? So, in this case, what I found, what I liked the most were from Gemini and probably, more than anything, Perplexity, okay? So, we have all these here. I mean, Tango Collagen is not a bad idea, if this one got rephrased, but it's not my favorite. It's okay, though. Uhm, I like this sort of dehydration debt, but I think, like, my issue with this was, like, I actually liked this a lot, but it was just moisture-focused, so they got all the pain points. The Elastase one, I didn't love the fact that it was, I don't know that elastase is a good enough. They'll put barrier breach and inflammation. This one here, that was okay. Which one had the anchors in it? Was that, Yeah, so it was a dehydration. So I like the moisture anchors content. Uhm, from Perplexity, I like the sort of periorbital collagen depletion mechanism. It's sort of simple, but I like it. The DEJ one I like, but I'd probably rather take it from the copy format we have from Marlander, which is gonna be, uh, I'm gonna do that right now. So I'm just copying these from my website. This is kind of an incomplete version of it, because there's some images on our website. By the way, our ice serum is like, the website, you know, things are working for us. Umm. a first shape of that explanation. So, let's evaluate them. So I'm gonna go ahead and download this as a PDF. We've got our evaluation prompt. But, let me do it like this here. You know what? Ah, good one second, you guys. What I want to do here, have my prompt ready. Here I'm doing, umm, Or, solution aware. Okay, so, let's go ahead and run- So we're gonna run it in the quad. I'm gonna do the same thing. I'm gonna run it in. I should say this. Perplexity. I'm not gonna say chat. I'm not gonna say quad, but I'll start with quad, so. Okay, moment. Okay, I was just trying to make sure I didn't remember that I did it in the unique mechanism project, which I did. So, I've got this here. I'm gonna upload the document, which is all the mechanism ideas, and the, uh, unified research brief. So a moment. Okay, those are uploading. Let's go ahead and run them. Meanwhile, are good friends at Gemini. What's wrong with this here? That was a good, uh, old one before I did the ingredients, I think. Yeah, so, let's just go to a new Gemini chat. Not deep research. A couple of these, okay, because I want to go in and we'll do it for friends. A chat security as well. Alright. There we go. Okay, let's look at the results here. Alright. Pause, honestly, answer some business stuff for my different company. These were not. But let's find out. I have not listed these yet, so I'm kind of nervous because both the city totally different, dramatically different things. And of course, the short answer is if that is what happens, we'll have to use our judgment probably. And again, the stuff I mentioned in the Airbnb video, example one too, where it's like, canvas and friends. Talk to people on the market. See what they think. Let's see. I don't laugh so nervous, but him. Okay, most likely. Lipid barrier breach and inflammation. It's perfectly explains the core frustration in products sensitivity and reactions burning irritation from potent greens through target market and it's tried multiple products cause irritation and this mechanism gives them a scientific reason why opposition products are gentle yet effective solution they've been seeking. Like it does solve that frustration, but that is not, I don't think the market's number one frustration. I think the pain points are the eye wrinkles, things that I turn, make them back to the unified research brief to be honest with you. Umm, stress hormone accumulation mechanism, glycation, curious for us to put the one that I like. And I wonder how much it has to do with the prompt. I wonder if I ever moved the UMP reminder, because it feels it feels like a formulation explanation, more than a unique. I mean, that one does, that one actually doesn't make sense, sorry. Umm, okay, the peri-oral-real collagen depletion mechanism, too similar to existing collagen messaging they've already heard, doesn't create sufficient differentiation from fellow products they've tried. Umm, here's an interesting question I'm going to ask. I'm going to take these different mechanism options. And combine them to a new mechanism that you thought was the strongest that speaks to their pain points, which are primarily parents driven, followed by what they don't like about the products. What would you do? And then I'm also gonna put, uhh, for context, here are the main ingredients. While I was doing that, let's see what Gemini says. Very interesting that Gemini also likes the lipid barrier reach in Infomaging. It makes me want to look at my unified research document, so I'm gonna do that. Okay. I mean, it's a good document. It's interesting, right? Because it's not like, it's not like this document is just focusing on, the pain point of proximity. So it's weird to me that the LOMs are focused so much on proximity. Umm. Like, am I missing something? It's almost weird. Umm. Dermal disarray has the number two. Claude had, Dermal disarray has the number three. Caught dehydration debt. Tried to confront some kind of solution. I really like the moisture anchors, which I mentioned here. Tier two strong contenders, elastase, cascade, dej, peptide delivery barrier, less likely to succeed. This is what I like to mostly like the least, right? This is not unique, right? So I think it's not, Unique and doesn't create a new knowledge gap. Okay. I still feel like I can make this one work, but it's very interesting. I mean, honestly, I might let this influence me to some level. I'm gonna ask it, umm, why didn't you decide that, products, since activity is one of the biggest and most important fears, frustrations for the market. Certainly, it's one of them. Surprise, you're giving that more credence than things like, I know I just had it open, I'm talking again. So they say, while we're waiting to say, let's see what 03 says if it's right over hit go. So we're gonna have a go now. While we're waiting for that, let's come back to Claude and see what they would do. I create a combined mechanism that addresses a big registration while creating logical release of story, the triple collapse kinda stops. The problem with the triple collapse cascade, the release of your experiments have failed, isn't what you think. Your until it's simple, collagen loss, but that's only one third of the story. The truth is, three interconnected systems around your eyes are collapsing simultaneously. Structural collapse, your collagen fibers have become tangled and chaotically, tent poles collapsing into no amount of collagen boosting can create firmness when the foundation is jumbled. Bear your collapse, look like a scrap of cracks in your skin's protective wall. allow moisters to escape while letting irritants flood in, triggering crack inflammation that destroys aging and explains why even gentle products now cause burning insensitivity. When tension collapse, your skin's moisture anchors are broken, so hydrating and green cyclic acid provide all temporary relief before evaporating. It's why you can spend $200 on a cream that works for days and stops. When your skin reacts, the props are used to tolerate, why your skin reacts, the props are used to tolerate. Alright, while you look tired, even after a full night sleep, each collapse feeds the others in vicious cycle. The UMS synchronize repair system. To reverse the triple collapse, you need a synchronize repair system that addresses all three failures simultaneously and that sequentially. Our formula works like a coordinate construction crew. I hate these construction crew analogies, by the way. It's like, I just was reading another piece of copy that was written for a female market, like a beauty, uh, collagen. you like, consumable product and the whole thing was like, the four man does this and the construction is like, is that what women are, like, oh yeah, that's what I used to my time thinking about is like, the, you know, or the art of a construction crew. It's like, I think they're so dumb. Okay, structural engineers send the bio attention, the security, signal to pool, tingle, collagen fibers, taut, organize, deliver pre-sorted building materials. and I'm sure you're listening build, create the strong foundation for lasting firmness, the barrier team, hydration team, why it works. Okay, maybe. Let's see what Joe and I said, okay. It's an excellent and safe question. You're correct that the visual and emotional pains are the fundamental motivators driving the consumer to seek a solution. The first place. The desire to reduce wrinkles and ringgit in confidence is the why behind their entire search. My decision to give proxensativity such high importance in the ranking is not because it's a greater pain than the wrinkles themselves because it represents a critical barrier to belief for this specific solution or customer. Here is strategic thinking behind that ranking. She has a history or failure. Sensitivity is a major buying objection, lipid barrier breach mechanism perfectly addresses that objection. It's not your fault. Solving the meta problem first. The desire to look better is probably a problem. The fear of irritation is a meta problem. It's a problem that prevents the solution from working. By addressing the barrier breach first, the biometric barrier of steel solution promises to create a protected state of environment. This response is powerful when producing peptides more believable because it assumptions how they work without causing irritation. Okay, interesting. And Chad GPT. Dermal disarray. Speaks directly to skin losing its snap. The number one structural pain that brief flags for frames past college and lost failures gives a vivid tempo analogy and positions peptides as precision architects rather than genetic boosters. But also science of accessibility and let's just lean- We'll in the on strong clinical proof to answer, I tried everything. Lipid barrier, breach, and infomaging. Preparing your skin's mortar sinks with the barrier skin care trend consumers already researched explains what sensitivity and dryness in one stroke processes a powerfully a gentle fix, exactly the objective projections set in the brief. Chronic dehydration debt, hydromagnetic lock system. Hydration is intuitive with the moisture anchors or broken story upgrades it from commodity H.A. claims and logical explains why power curves felt good only for hours to 22 hour lock because of concrete testable promise. Still I see last taste cascade. D.E.J., it's fine how it has everything at D.A.J. number five. So it's interesting if I'm sitting here. By the way, I don't actually really like what Claude did. I don't mind it. I just think it becomes confusing. It's like I don't know that I need all of these steps. We go back to like our original sort of what the market likes doesn't like. They kind of don't like these multi-step systems and all these things. So I just feel like simplicity is better. But if we go back to like the rankings, okay, it had the Big Barrier Breach in Inflammaging 1, Dehydring Debt 2, Dromodus Ray 3. Then we had the Big Barrier Breach 1, Dromodus Ray 2, Thank you. I think, uh, sorry, Chronic Dehydrogen Debt. Yeah, 3, okay. Chatsy BT, Dromodus Ray 1, the Big Barrier Breach 2, Chronic Dehydrogen Debt 3. We just want to have my little peri-orbital collagen thing number 6. So I think what I would do now, we've got this slipping barrier breach as number 1 for Gemini and quad. So, I think what I would do is I would go ahead and do expanded mechanisms and see how I feel about it when it's, ran out in more depth, which I'm now going to do. Alright, so here we are in our quad expansion prompt. We're three echotic-pasted and this is from Airbnb, right? So, let's do our little bit barrier and Put it in the little thing. So, we'll copy and paste this in. Highlight it. Who are, I'm going to achieve- Cheers. Keep and go problem. Yeah, I think it's a short case. Oh, I guess we would say- Would I say solution or a proctor? Umm, I guess solution or- Yeah, solution or where. Umm. I'm curious because of what you mentioned is a product sensitivity. That's what I'm curious about. Umm. So, let's find out. Let's go to our friend as a quad. We're on the project. I'm coming pasting this prompt in. We're not- Upload the brief. Alright, turn my prompt into this little chat file. Let's see what we get here. So, the audience already knows how time starts to exist. Do this. Okay. Our solution wearer didn't have that. So, I might change this prompt, because we didn't define the, I don't know where a problem was with solution wearer. So, what I might do here, hmm. So, if you're here, we're just squeaking up my elbow on the, my desk. Ready? Okay. There we go. Umm, what I'm gonna do, Okay, moment. You can't see here. Let's see what it wrote, okay? Researching it? See, yeah, I don't like this right, cuz I don't, I want it to be, so we're gonna rerun the prompt. But here's what we're gonna be testing as experimenters that continue on, right? Umm. Uh. So I'm gonna copy and paste it in from our other prompt, is we can look at the classic levels of prompt mark awareness as I've treated you in a source. Okay. Here's a follow-up for our answer. Let's not consider how to wear it. Most of it will be for our supposed to prompt in brand. Actually, you know what I'm gonna do? I was thinking about how to do this. I'm actually gonna do it differently. Give me a moment here. I know you are just watching me stare at the screen. But I want to find, I'm in over here. What I'm trying to do right now, I'm going through our, this was our product market awareness level. Unaware, probably aware. This is what I'm gonna do. And I would probably say to add this to the process. Umm. I'll do this instead. Umm. Here's how you can understand. It's solution aware. In this context. So now, I will- I want to go ahead and try this again. I'm gonna upload my unified research brief again. And let's run it again and see. Cause we saw the other one. I want to start immediately going like, oh, you know all about peptides. And I'm like, I don't know that I want you to take that level of assumption, right? So I think this one should be better. See, this is better, okay? The hidden reason your eye cream is in working and what it actually does. You may be thinking, I tried eye cream before, some expensive ones, some highly rated ones, but I'm still seeing those fine lines getting deeper, my under eyes. So tired of my how much I sleep again. If that's what I'm going to do is. Cause I'm about to share with you explains why 9 out of 10 eye creams on the market today, even the $200 ones from department stores are essentially expensive moisturizers that can never address the real problem. The real problem is your skin's security system is in breach. See, most of them don't realize that the delicate skin around your eyes has what dermatologists call a lipid barrier. Think of it like the security system for your skin. I don't love these metaphors, but that's okay. I just want to see how I like this in action. This barrier can be visualized as a protective wall made of brick. Some mortar with skin cells are the bricks and the natural fats and oil surrounding them are the mortar that holds everything together. But here's what happens as we age, especially after 40. This protective mortar begins to break down. Home oil changes and environmental stress, even the simple act of blinking thousands of times a day creates microscopic cracks and gaps in the dirt. And notice happens two devastating things occur that directly explain where you're struggling. First, uncontrolled moisture loss. The side cracks act like an open window along your skin's precious moisture to escape throughout the day. This is why your IRA feels chronically dry and tight, and why even the richest eyelid cream seems to disappear within hours. Second, the gateway to inflammation. But the moisture loss is actually the least of your problems because the same cracks create an open door for irritants, pollutants, and allergens to penetrate deep into your skin. This constant invasion triggers your immune system, creating what scientists have recently discovered, and named inflammation. It's a persistent, low-grade inflammation that's finally destroying your collagen and a lasting inflammation. Now, this is why your skin becomes so sensitive, why ingredients used to work fine now cause burning or irritation? Your skin's protective wall is compromised through even well-formulated products feel harsh because they're penetrating too quickly into an already inflamed environment. Why traditional eye creams can't fix this? Now you understand why your expensive eye creams haven't worked. You're trying to treat the symptoms, the dryness, the lines, the puffiness, but you're completely ignoring the breech barrier that's causing all these problems in the first place. So tryin' to heat it up. You can't blast the heat, you can blast the heat all you want until you fix the windows you're finally losing battle. The solution to the biomimetic barrier seal, the way to address the consequences of a breech barrier is to repair the wall itself. This requires what I call a biomimetic barrier seal. Complex and intelligent ingredients that don't just sit on top of your skin, but actually integrate with your natural barrier to patch those cracks and restore its protective function. So. As behind the seal, it kind of goes through some of the ingredients, how it works. What it does, okay? Cool. Definitely better. Things we're sitting on love with, but at least I can see how it looks in person. What about the next one? Well, let's see that next one, okay? So. So for this one, copying that, so it's got the solution of our breakdown. And let's do it, whatever it was, our number two. Which was a little dermal disarray. I still don't know if I love that tent analogy, to be honest with you, but, Let's just see. Sorry, what is my darkness, Evan? Umm. Okay. Let's go and try that with that one. Some prompt. Let's run it. Let's go and have a question via text. Here's what surprised you. For the most woman to probably try callous eye creams, you know the peptides are supposed to help with wrinkles and firmness, you've read reviews, floorage on departments for eye cream. Here's a- No one's concurring to see who wants you to know. The reason your peptide creams haven't worked. I don't know why. It's not your peptide creams. Welcome back to that. You'll see for decades, the beauty industry has sold you a simple story. Your skin is aging because you're losing collagen, so they create products to boost collagen or flange- It sounds logical, right? But recently the research has revealed that collagen lasts so they have the story, and it's not even the most important half. The real culprit, buying the stubborn growth speed, the creepy eye skin, and the way your eyes suddenly look tired, even when you're not, is something scientists are not calling a dream. What is the right? Let me explain. Think of healthy, young skin like a perfectly pitched tent. Collagen fibers are like the tent's framework, tightly woven, organized, and strong. Everything in its proper place creates a smooth, taut surface. That's- We're the way. As we each think more damaging than a simple collagen loss occurs, those collagen fibers don't just disappear. They become tangled, weak, and chaotic. Instead of that strong, organized mesh, your general structure becomes like a clob's tent. This is done with its array. This is an incredibly pumped, more materials. It's sort of the entirety of the structure. So, I'm gonna ask a couple things here. Umm, a couple of things. First- First, I talked about the peptide. First, you said that I had specific- I defied that solution where people we are talking to aren't necessarily aware of peptide hydrines. Right, so I don't think- that makes sense. Okay, second, uhh, I can't- don't love the names. Dermal disarray. Or the endermal disarray. Really love the tent algae either. I think it's okay. What? There. There. More believable. Legit sounding names can we use? Instead of Dermal disarray and what are some other allergies or metaphors if it used? Instead of a tent keeping in mind our target market. Other names, college and fragmentation syndrome, structural college and breakdown. Collagen network collapse, structural protein disintegration. Dermal framework deterioration. Collagen architecture breakdown. I like simplicity. I'm going to go call it an architectural breakdown. Umm. I don't know how to control this. It's a kind of, Can I have, like, fabric? Because it's sort of, like, a knitting. We've even had that woman, like, knitting, but, like, it's sort of more, uhh, I mean, we're sentimental. I think about, like, grandma, all that kind of stuff. So, I'm going to say, Let's use...let's address. Number one, I can't see, but it's on the news. Just number one, I let you agree. Let's use collagen. Architecture. Right down, and that's what, right? It doesn't really matter. Let's use the fabric weave analogy. out. Alright, I'll talk to you later. You're not as something scientists are not calling collagen architecture breakdown. Let me explain what this means. Think of collagen. Think of healthy, young skin like a piece of high quality fabric with a perfectly tight organized weave. Every thread in its proper place, working together to create a smooth, strong, beautiful surface that drays perfectly. But as we age, think far more damaging, the simple thread loss occurs. Those collagen threads not just disappear, you become loose, tangled, and looser organized structure. Instead of that tight, for sex weave, your skin's foundation becomes like, The fabric that's been stretched and twisted into the threads are all jumbled together. This is collagen architecture breakdown. This is why simply trying to add more collagen to your skin is like trying to add more threads to fabric that's already lost to weave. Remember how much collagen boosting cream you apply? If the underlying structure has broken down, your skin can't maintain its firmness. The wrinkles keep forming, the skin keeps sagging, and your skin keeps flowing frustrated. This explains what you might notice that your skin feels different now. It's all set, snappy. It keeps to have, when you smile, those lines don't bounce back what they want to say. The skin around your eyes feels looser somehow. That's collagen architecture breakdown in action, but here's the breakthrough. Umm, let's continue with the Bio10 Segrity solution before. So, I didn't look at that part too much here. Let's see. Call Bio10 Segrity system. So, okay, great. Much better. For, hopefully this is still going. Makes me nervous. I'm going to do this video in two parts. I'm going to do this again. And for the UMS, I don't like bio-tensegrity system as a name. I don't feel like it's easy to understand or remember. Since Tyler, a protective shield is okay, but kind of generic. What are alternative names? I like a lot of these, I'm thinking about an architecture, and so an argument was really talking about this architecture thing above. And so, while I like the architecture restoration method, I also feel like that's a little bit, maybe not as understandable. So I'm gonna go for, like, I think the structural renewal system. Makes sense? I'll- Like, um, yeah. Idea of par. Structural renewal system, okay? So it's my materials. These ones- ones. Uhm, I like, but let's call it a targeted repair complex. I like complex. And then third. Let's go with. We have integrity, locking, compiles, and greens. Essentially, I don't know. So, again, this isn't our final version, but I just might as well play around with this, right? Umm. We've prepared a system I didn't hate, but I just feel like it's just, it's too, You don't have to title it the metaphor, so that's why I like that one. So let's go ahead and do that. Okay. Call it structural renewal systems. System works in three precise steps. Structural renewal signal. Okay, does this, Missionary to pull this loose tail collision thread is taught, and we run it as a back in the proper tail weave. Tighten up. Okay, fine. Two target repair complex. Target repair complex comes in. Included, perseximino acids, pilling, glysine, and alanine. Terri locking compounds by it. Person makes it really unique. Umm. System active compounds also function as an terri locking. A component, a a a component. you locking compounds. Again, I might not use compound choice for your newly restored skin structure to actively inhibit the enzymes called matrix mellow proton aces that break down collagen and destroy the leaf in the first place, single mistreating. Okay, so if I have this to be honest with you, I think it's pretty good. Obviously, I would, um, play with things more, and we'll keep doing it. We're gonna write the I's from VSL as part of R&B C. to you too. So, um, you know, we'll see. I might change my mind. I might, I could, you know, I might do the same exercise with other UMPs as well, but I think this is valuable for you to watch for those of you who have actually continued to watch through to the end because you can sort of see how you can take an idea that's pretty good, but again, maybe the name isn't great or some of the naming convention. Things aren't awesome or you don't like the metaphor and you can change and work with AI to get things that you like more, right? And so, oh, do you see that? I'll save all of this and, um, we'll continue on with more videos and modules. I think, you know, I'm gonna do the cloud project. I think I can mention like a separate quick training how to set one up because you've seen it in action now. Like, I'm using. In that here, keep in mind, right? Umm. I'm gonna do other videos, I'm not sure for the mechanism or stuff. Um, but, and then I mentioned golf, but honestly, I feel like these are such long videos, you get the point. I think you can just do it for, and, you know, you saw one of this non-physical, one of this physical, um, should be clear enough. So, I'll probably move on to- other sections after this video, besides the cloud project thing. Umm, but, maybe I'll add stuff in the future, I don't know. Anyway, thank you for watching. Bye.

### Armadilha 2: [Nome do erro]
**O que acontece**: Alright, so I'm back here. And the first thing I want to do in this video is I want to close the gap. I needed a little break, but I showered and feel refreshed now. So I want to kind of close, or I want to finish the loop on the same prompt we looked at before for our B&B arbitrage that I re-ran with Gemini. And I did add as a template, to the template to this prompt, like, just to, I think I decided I want to just explicitly tell them, you know, what segment to target, which is what we did in this one, right? So, uhm, I didn't like this follow-up prompt we looked at, right? That was not really working. This is a very fluid, dynamic thing. Uhm, what we did in this prompt here, we basically said, for this exercise, let's specifically focus on people who are in the, in the market. who are problem-aware, right? So, I'll put this into the example. we ran deep research again. It does a lot, I mean, this is, it's good stuff, like, this is all really interesting, but, uhm, it's kind of an interesting structure they do. Like, it started with this kind of, like, conceptual framework, right? This is what it did with our last deep research one too and there's sort of the flawed opportunity map. And it's, it's, like, interesting, but it's not really, like, this one, it's, it, the way the structure is on this, it doesn't really feel concrete enough. But now you get the actual mechanism categories, right? Category one, the system mechanism, okay? So, 2.1, unique mechanism, the asset liability inversion, the problem mechanism, digital assertiveness. I like that concept, that's evocative, right? Nobody wants to be a serf. So, let's read through it. The core reason every online side hustle the prospect has tried has left them feeling powerless and like they are building someone else's dream instead of their own can be explained by a single corrosive concept, digital serfdom. In every venture within the digital gold rush, they have been unknowingly trapped in a modern feudal system where they don't build on rented land. Consider the structure of these businesses. When they attempted drop shipping, they were taught to spend their capital on ads to drive traffic. They assumed the liability of ad spend, customer service, and returns. The true asset, the customer data, the platform's processing fees, the ad revenue, were captured by Shopify, Meta, or Google. The prospect was a tenant farmer tilling the digital soil for the platform lords. When they tried freelancing, the They built a client's business, the asset, while retaining only the liability of constantly needing to find the next client to survive. The moment they stopped working, the income vanished. This framework perfectly articulates their past experiences. It gives a name to the systemic reason why their hard work resulted in so little equity and control. Their feeling of powerlessness was not just a feeling, it was the architectural reality of these business models. They were structured to be the surf, never the sand, the lord, the solution mechanism of asset control arbitrage. It's a cool name, I like the name arbitrage, plays well in biz op, it's cool. The rental arbitrage program teaches a method to fundamentally invert this broken model through asset control arbitrage. This is the loophole that allows them to achieve the psychological and financial benefits of real estate investment without the traditional barriers that have priced them out of the market. The process works by separating asset control arbitrage control from asset ownership, right? So this is cool, people can kind of get this, it sounds legit, sounds like a serious thing, but it's not actually, like, complicated, you know? The prospect learns how to gain legal and operational control over a high value cash flowing physical asset, a residential property, without needing the massive down payment, high credit score, or mortgage liability associated with traditional ownership. The financial structure is inverted in their favor. The liability, their primary liability, is the monthly rent paid to the landlord. This cost is fixed, predictable, and contractually defined. The asset, they control the revenue-generating potential of the property on the short-term rental market. This upside is uncapped, directly influenced by their management, and flows directly to them. This mechanism bridges the gap between their desire for real estate and their financial limitations. Their ambition for real estate is not just about money, it is the psychological need for something tangible, controllable, and a role to fleeting, intangible demand. A physical property feels real and permanent compared to a defunct drop-shipping store. Asset control arbitrage positions rental arbitrage not as another side hustle, but as a savvy, accessible entry point into the world of real estate, investing they thought was close to them forever. Forever close to them. So I think that's a cool one, I like it. So let's take that, and add it to our list. And this is the only one I looked at so far, so there might be other cool ones, let's find out. Unique mechanism, the permission-based income trap. Let's see, a unifying thread running through every source of frustration is the prospects financial life, or sorry, in the prospects financial life, is that all their income is permission-based. Their ability to earn money is perpetually at the mercy of a third party, which explains the profound lack of control over their time, schedule, and life decisions. This framework can be used to diagnose all their past and present struggles. The 9-to-5 job, their primary income is based on their boss's permission to remain employed. Gig economy work, income from platforms like Uber or DoorDash is based on the permission of an algorithm that can change their earning potential without notice. Freelancing, income is contingent on a client's permission to continue the contract. Online businesses, their dropshipping or affiliate marketing income was fundamentally based on the permission of ad platforms like Facebook and Google, which are notorious for shutting down accounts overnight, instantly vaporizing a business. This permission-based framework gives a single damning label to all their experiences of powerlessness. It shows them that whether they were working for a boss or for themselves, they were never truly in control. They were always asking for permission from someone else. It shows them that if you're someone who seeks autonomy, freedom, to be your own boss, to chart your own course, this idea of like a world where you're supposed to get your success and livelihood and survival. is dependent on the permission of someone else is repelling, right? Like it's repulsive. Like you don't like it. And this idea of like a permissionless cashflow system where you're the boss and it's like a rebel archetype or attitude is very cool. The program teaches them how to build a permissionless cashflow system. This mechanism directly counters the trap of permission-based income by creating a business where after initial setup. Phase, the income stream is generated by the open market and flows directly to them. The process involves a single critical point of permission, negotiating the lease and arbitrage addendum with the property owner. This is framed not as asking for permission in the same vein as a boss or an but as a strategic one-time partnership negotiation to acquire a master key to an Once this master key is secured and the property is listed, the dynamic shifts entirely. No boss can fire them for their property. No algorithm can suddenly deprioritize their lease. No client can decide to stop paying them. The income is generated by travelers and guests in the free market and the cash flow is deposited directly into their account. This mechanism powerfully delivers on the core promise of take back control and be your It positions the business not as another fragile venture dependent on the whims of others, but as a robust, resilient system for generating income on their own terms. It offers a tangible. Path to the autonomy they crave more than anything else. So I like this one as well. and you might be wondering again. Well, how do I choose? There's so many first thing I want you to do is just understand that we're learning about unique mechanisms problem solutions. We're looking at these together as examples. Um, but we will get into the selection criteria or a framework for selecting them shortly. I don't want to bury it in this video because I'll have to probably repeat it at the start of the next video. So I'll probably save it for that, but we will, we will get to that. Okay. Um, section three, mechanism category 2. The Effort Mechanisms. Let's see. Unique mechanism, the act of taking passive decay rate. The problem mechanism. The reason the prospects previous side hustles led to burnout instead of freedom can be explained with a scientific sounding concept. The income decay rate. I love it. Most income streams, especially in the digital gold rush, have a near a hundred percent decay rate. This means the moment active daily effort ceases, the income plummets to zero. Freelancer stops prospecting for new clients, sees their pipeline dry up and their income disappear. The dropshipper returns off their daily effort, the ad campaign sees their sales immediately halt. The gig economy driver who doesn't turn on their app earns nothing. This concept validates their lived experience, explains why these ventures never felt like a path to passive income, and set a second job that was even more demanding than their first. So, let's see. They have the solution mechanism, the compounding hospitality engine. I know we had another one with a hospitality engine, which I liked. But, I think it's okay if it's twice. I don't, you know, this one to me is not as good as the other ones, but it's cool. It's not bad. In stark contrast, the rental arbitrage system is designed to create an asset with a very low decay rate. The solution is framed as building a compounding hospitality engine. This model is characterized by strategic front-loading of effort followed by a period of semi-passive durable cash flow. This process is broken into two distinct phases, the engine build, and the engine operation. The income stream from this engine is not only durable, but also compounding positive guest reviews out to the flywheel, increasing the listing's visibility, ranking, and pricing power over time. This directly addresses their desire for a passive income that covers all living expenses and income streams that work while you sleep, provides a clear logical and believable path from a finite period of active work to a sustainable, loaded case system that generates wealth over the longterm. So again, not, maybe not, is my favorite, but certainly not bad. And there is more. Okay. The competitive saturation paradox. Let's see this here. The prospect's failure in previous online businesses was not their fault. It was a mathematical certainty. They were unknowingly caught in the competitive saturation paradox. This paradox states that for business models with extremely low barriers time. Entry, the ease of starting is inversely proportional to the probability of succeeding. It's maybe a little bit too complex for them, but let's just look. Their past ventures at dropshipping and affiliate marketing operate on a single, on a principle of global competition. When they launched their online store, they were just competing with other entrepreneurs. They were not just competing with other entrepreneurs in their city or country. They're competing with millions of others from around the world for the same limited pool of customers attention on platforms, uh, limited pool of customer attention on platforms like Facebook and Google. This explains precisely why those markets felt oversaturated. The structure of the game itself preordained mass failure. This reframes their past losses, not as a personal failure, but as a predictable outcome of playing an unwinnable game. The solution mechanism, the hyper-local monopoly strategy. This program teaches them to escape the unwinnable global arena by executing a hyper-local monopoly strategy. This mechanism directly confronts their fear of market saturation and turns it into a core strategic advantage. The fear of saturation is one of the primary objections to the rental arbitrage model. Everyone is doing this now, so it won't work anymore. This fear is a direct projection of their trauma from failing in over-saturated online markets. The hyper-local- by the way, I think you could also say hyper-saturated markets in general, not just online, like Uber, DoorDash, things like that, right? The hyper-local monopoly mechanism dismantles this belief by highlighting the fundamental difference between digital and physical markets. Instead of competing with the entire internet, they are taught to compete on a hyper-local scale. Their market is not the road, it is the three blocks surrounding the downtown convention center or the specific neighborhood near the university hospital. Their competition is not millions of anonymous dropshippers, it is a handful of other rental units in a single building or on a single street. By teaching them how to identify the right property in a high-demand micro-location, how to optimize their listing service and pricing, the program shows them how to become the number one choice in a tiny, profitable, and defensible market. They can achieve a form of market dominance that is simply impossible in the globalized digital space. This turns their biggest fear of saturation into the business model's greatest strength, local defensibility. That is also, I think, a pretty cool and good mechanism. So I'm still adding these all to my little sheet here. I mean, gosh, there's so many, right? So in this guru blind spot, I'm gonna skip this because I just still don't think, like, the guru thing is, like, for, problem aware. I'm sorry, for, yeah, for problem aware. This is sort of, like, a bullshit one. Like, it's sort of a way of just saying something obvious in a fancy way, but, It's not terrible, so I'll read the beginning of it. The Information vs. Transformation Fallacy. The prospect's fundamental error in their past attempts at self-improvement and business building is that they have been trying to solve a transformation problem with an information solution. This is the information fallacy. The goal is profound, life-altering transformation. They want to quit their job forever, achieve complete autonomy over their lives, and find lasting financial peace of mind. This is a monumental undertaking that requires a change in identity, habits, and skills. The tools they've been using to achieve this goal are low-cost DIY courses from platforms like Udemy, isolated YouTube tutorials, and cheap PDFs. These are purely information products. The fallacy lies in the belief that simply possessing information can create transformation. It's akin to trying to become a world-class athlete by reading a book about exercise. This explains why those cheap courses result in information without implementation help and a feeling of isolation when challenges arise. Information in a vacuum is powerless to create real-world change. The solution mechanism of the transformation ecosystem. So, it's like a three-part thing for the course, right? The blueprint, the community, the mentorship. I think that one's pretty cool. I probably would not include this in my list. Why would I not include this in my list? I would not include it in my list because I don't know that it actually says enough of, like, actual substance and it still feels a little more solution-aware than problem-aware. Where some of those kind of get into that territory, but this one I feel like really assumes, like, they've been doing courses in Udemy and whatever, and I think that could be fine, but for my example, it's not something I feel like I want to put, and so there you go, okay? Now, Now, I'll end this video, kind of consider this part two of the ideation of LLMs. Uhm, there's going to be some, like I said, later on we'll talk about some things with Cloud Projects and other ways we can do it. I, but we're going to go in a minute into that UMP evaluation thing and kind of how we evaluate UMPs, uh, in general, and then a, a system for, for doing it with LLMs, the help of LLMs. Okay. So we'll do that. Give me one minute, I want to check, I want to add one thing to this. So what I was looking at is I have a Cloud Project for Unique Mechanisms, which I taught as a good bonus to a course. And, some of these ideas that were in Gemini come up here as well. A few are kind of unique. I think they're decent, but I don't think they're so good that I need to include them. So I'm going to move on to the next module, and I'll share this Cloud Project, uh, you know, as a bonus, um, or part of the section later. So, there we go. I thank you.

Okay, so here's where it gets, I think, actually really cool and really helpful, which is evaluating which of the unique mechanisms to go with. So, as a copywriter, I'm going to not make this too theoretical or philosophical, but there's a good book I read about it, but I'm going to for a minute, You know, there's a really good book about, um, you know, AI wrote early on, um, but really honestly, I mean, like, 2021, 2022, I think it was called, like, um, what's it called? Power and Prediction, I think, something like that. Yeah. It's by some University of Toronto AI scientists, um, and there's another one. When it came out, it says it here, but, um, essentially one of the things that they talked about is this gap, you could call it, that exists between, I'll simplify it like this way. There's one thing to get great outputs, there's another thing to have judgment, right? And so, their argument was where AI will take longer to supplant humans is when it comes to judgment. By judgment, I mean, like, okay, hey, here's four colors that I could paint the inside of a house for a client without, you know, here's the information of the client, which color should I choose? Here's the thing, that's not even a great example, because AI is actually getting pretty good at judgment, but they don't have the total overall edge here. So, when you do mechanisms like in the processes I've shared and you're a really good copywriter, a really seasoned person, you might, no, you might, sorry, I'm going to say it differently, you will probably have opinions on which mechanisms you like the most, right? So, if we kind of come back to our examples, like the one from Gemini, uhm, let's see, the ICM one. So we had this Gemini thing here, right? And I really liked the asset gap versus the income gap. If you watched that video, you saw how excited I got, I'm like, this is sick, like, it was the one. I got the most excited about, uhm, up until that point, right? I really liked it. Because I really like the idea of you're trying to solve an asset gap problem with an income gap solution. It's like a good big idea. We'll talk about big ideas, but it's like, it's really intuitively grasped. You can intuitively grasp it. It sounds like a real thing. Like, it's good, right? Uhm, then, if you go back to the second time we ran it, we're told it to focus on problem-aware. Digital serfdom. I liked, and then the idea of the permission-based income trap, I really liked, right? And I liked some of the others, too. We saved those all and took a, a document. But if you watched, I think you would say that I'm telling the truth. You could tell that I got excited about those ones, and some other ones, too. And I'm partly pre-framing this because of the outputs that I got. But the reason I was excited wasn't just purely a gut feeling. It wasn't, it was an intuition, but it was also based on experience and knowledge and all these things that are generally hard to replace. And they're generally why I'm going to typically beat you if we go head-to-head on copywriting or marketing or all that. And what I'm sharing with you is a blueprint where if you follow it, that may not be true. And by the way, I mean, it's not just copy. If we go back to the product market awareness, it's at a really high level of a lot of stuff, right? Because now, you know, if you're paying attention, who to speak to, what language to use, what not to do, right? How to shoot, not shoot yourself in the foot by going after a different level of product marketing. market awareness than you should be, and so on. Right? So, giving you all that context. But the question becomes, what if I, well, sorry, I feel like I'm doing non-sequitur sentences. It's kind of late, but I'm excited to do this module, so I wanted to just do it now so the question becomes okay look what if I What if I don't have that experience or that judgment? What can I do? And while it may be uncomfortable, asking AI to evaluate for you, at this point, with good models, is not Not a bad idea, and it's typically going to actually make pretty good sense. Decisions. So let's look at this, how we do that, okay? I'm working on some direct response sales copy that will sell a product to niche. I'm going to share a few documents with you. The first is a unified research document that has relevant information for a market that my business will be selling to. It includes information, The level of product market awareness we'll be speaking to, competitor analysis, and key psychographic information. The second document has several unique mechanism ideas that could be used in our sales copy when selling our products or services to the market. Here's a reminder of what a unique mechanism is and why it's important. So same thing we had before, that unique mechanism stuff. Here's what I want you to do. Evaluate each unique mechanism idea based on their potential for connecting to our target market and persuading them to buy the product we are selling and rank them from most likely to succeed to least likely to succeed. In order to make this evaluation, consider the unified research brief and the beliefs, attitudes, awareness levels, and competitive environment within which our target customer finds themselves. When making your rankings, keep in mind that our core market is people who are problem aware. This is something you could change out. Please go ahead and do this now. Okay, that's the whole prompt. You could substitute in a product to niche, or you can not. So, let's look at this in action. First place I did it was Claw. I didn't even change, uh, you know, this out. It said product niche. I uploaded the unified research brief for the Airbnb, uh, rental arbitrage coaching program and those mechanisms that I had here. I saved them as a PDF and uploaded them, right? So, let's see Claw's ranking. Looking at your unique mechanism ideas through the lens of your problem or target market, I'll evaluate and rank them based on their potential to connect with prospects who are actively seeking ways to make more money, but haven't yet identified rental arbitrage as their solution. Ranking most to least likely to succeed. Number one, the asset gap Bye. Why? It's number one. This mechanism perfectly diagnoses the core frustration of your problem or audience. They're stuck in the end. My cat is coming up here trying to make a cameo. He's going to get kicked out in a second, but let me finish this paragraph before I do. They're stuck in the endless cycle of seeking more income through side hustles when their real problem is lacking wealth building assets. This directly addresses their experience of trying dropshipping, freelancing, and gig work only to remain financially stable. The language of being confined to earning active income versus building wealth through appreciating cash flowing assets will resonate deeply with prospects who feel that traditional paths aren't working. All right, the cat was kicked out. Number two, the permission-based income trap, mechanism 2.2. Why is number two? This powerfully explains their feelings of powerlessness across all their income sources from their nine to five to their failed side hustles. The concept that they're always asking for permission to earn a living will create immediate recognition. The solution to building a permissionless cash flow system directly delivers on their core desire to take back control and be your own boss. So, I asked Claude, ChatTVT, and Gemini, by the way, for their rankings on this. Uhm, but it is kind of crazy when you think about it. I mean, I wish I had just ranked them personally. Personally, before I did this exercise, so for some of the other examples I'll do, like skincare, golf, whatever it is, I probably will, uhm, do that to see how they match up or whatever. But, whatever. Number three. Uh, digital serfdom. Asset control arbitrage. Mechanism 2.1. Uh, why is number three? Digital serfdom concept brilliantly explains why all their online ventures left them feeling like they were building someone else's dream. The metaphor of being a tenant farmer on digital platforms will strongly resonate with their past failures. However, it's slightly less universal than the permission-based income trap since it specifically targets digital failures rather than all income sources. That's something I brought up too, remember? Uhm, and it goes on to, you know, do the rest of these. The active to passive decay rate. Uhm, the capital efficiency threshold, the competitive saturation paradox, the franchise-in-a-box operating system. Let's see what I said about this one. This mechanism focuses more on how the solution works rather than why they're stuck. While it addresses their overwhelm with scattered information, it doesn't create the paradigm shift that the higher rate mechanisms provide. It's more tactical than transformational. The automated hospitality engine. I did like this idea, to be fair. And they have it at number 8. Similar to the franchise mechanism, this is more about the solution delivery than problem diagnosis. While it addresses the fear of creating another time-consuming job, it doesn't explain the deeper reasons for their past failures. And it's probably fair. And then the capital multiplier at number 9. Okay. So, what we can do is, you know, we'll just say, we'll just keep that in mind for now. So we had, we had the asset gap versus income gap, permission-based income, digital serfdom, active or passive. Let's see what chat GPT says. So I asked it the same prompt, thought for 2 minutes and 49 seconds, using O3 Pro. So it had asset gap versus income gap, asset control method. Um, which is very interesting. And guess what number 2 was? Permission-based income trap. Is that really, to me, that's, it's fascinating. Cause like those were like my favorite ones. And it gives you sort of pros and cons, right? So why do, why does it like the asset gap versus income gap? Refrains the prospect's core frustrations. I need a higher paycheck. Has the wrong diagnosis and reveals the missing piece. They have an asset gap, not an income gap. Turns rental arbitrage into the first believable bridge from. Labor to asset ownership without banks or big down payments, mapping perfectly to their desire to build wealth through real estate without mortgages, immediately differentiates the offer from every side hustle or make money pitch they've already tried key URB pain point links. I don't know what those are. Many of us watch out, so must keep the math simple and concrete, avoid abstract econ jargon. Number two, permission-based income trap. Permissionless cashflow system speaks straight to the autonomy control pain. Bosses, algorithms, client control, main income gives a single memorable villain, permission-based income, and a clear escape route requiring only one negotiated. These evokes take back control. Be your own boss language. The testing shows this market loves, um, needs strong proof that landlord agreements truly are a one and done to overcome fear of eviction, legal issues. Cool. Then add the Capital Multiplier Framework. Now for Quad, they put that as number 5. Chatspeak data is number 3. Uh, obliterates the capital barrier objection up front and price of real estate, promises escape velocity, rolling cashflow funds to the next unit, which taps their hunger for momentum and fire-style compounding, uses the sticky phrase ownership fallacy to explain why past advice failed. And then for number 4, Capital Efficiency Threshold, which Quad had, wait a second, Capital Multiplier Framework, you know, sorry, Quad had, the efficiency thing is 5, and the multiplier is number 9, so that was different. But if I'm looking at this, and I'd ask it in digital search. I would them down here, uhm, and it is worth, like, seeing, right, like, okay, so like, I like this digital search thing, what does it not like about it? Medieval metaphor made polarizer feel more dramatic in shorter ad formats. So that's valid, right? So that's why I ranked it lower. So I still, like, liked it, it's just that it feels like in shorter ad formats, uhm, it might be hard to pull that off. Maybe not, though. Again, I still like it, but, uhm, you know, that's a valid criticism. And then I, like I said, I like the automated hospitality engine, which I had, quad hat as number 8, this one has it as 6. Direct handout on the time, burnout pain, I don't want another job, pacing attractive end state, strong differentiator for skewer courses that leave opposite students, works best after they believe arbitrage is viable, at problem aware stage it can sound like a software demo. And I think that's valid, that's something I mentioned where, like, it was talking more to problem aware people, uhm, or sorry, more like solution aware people, this is more problem aware, right? Uhm, but, you know, I kind of like this, How does saturation paradox ever look? Although it's very much, I agree that that would be more for a solution aware market. Least urgent for problem aware prospects, they haven't seen an arbitrage, so saturation is in front of mind. Keep for deeper funnel retargeting, right? Okay, cool. How to use this ranking. All right, so, kind of cool. We're already seeing Claude and ChatTVT both agree on the top two. What about Gemini? So, same exact prompt, Gemini. Number one, the permission-based income trap. We have permission-based income trap as, there's number two for Claude and ChatTVT, number one for Gemini. This mechanism is ranked highest due to its profound emotional resonance and stability to unify all of the targets in the market's frustrations under a single powerful concept. Core idea, the process financial struggle stemmed from the fact that all their income sources from their nine-to-five jobs to their failed side hustles are permission-based, meaning they're dependent on the whims of a boss, a client, or a platform algorithm. The solution is to build a permissionless cashflow system where they are finally in control. Connection to the problem where market diagnoses a core emotional pain. The research brief report repeatedly highlights additional desperation to escape the soul-sucking nine-to-five grind and a feeling of powerlessness in their current employment situation. This mechanism gives that feeling a name, validating their experience that they lack control over the time, schedules, and life decisions. Reframes all the past failures. It brilliantly explains why their jobs feel like a trap and why their attempts at gig work, freelancing, and job shipping felt just as precarious. It shows them that even when working for themselves, they were never truly controlled, but were instead at the mercy of platforms that could shut them down overnight, offers the ultimate promise. The deepest desires of this market is complete, or the deepest desire is complete autonomy and the ability to take back control. The permissionless cashflow system is a direct and powerful promise that delivers on this exact dream. Verdict. This mechanism is the most potent because it focuses on the psychological root of the prospect's pain, a lack of control, which is even deeper than their financial frustration. And then number two had the asset gap versus the income gap and digital serfdom. So kind of curious how they combined it. This is a very close second trading some of the raw emotional power of the permission angle for paradigm shifting intellectual insight that is perfectly tailored to this audience. Core idea. The prospect has been trying to solve an asset gap problem, not owning cash flowing assets with a net income gap solution, trying to earn more from labor. Their past failure in online businesses were a form of digital serfdom, but it took all the risk while platform lords like Google and Shopify reap the rewards from the true assets, the platform data. The solution is asset control arbitrage, which allows them to gain control of a real physical asset without the prohibitive cost of ownership. So it's kind of interesting. Um, Gemini liked income gap number two, but it kind of, uh, worked in the serfdom idea, which is kind of neat connection to the problem or market. Obviously we're thinking it respects their intelligence by introducing a sophisticated economic concept that perfectly explains their feeling of being in a big economic system. It shows them why trying to make more money through dropshipping or freelancing was preordained to fail at building wealth. Perfectly reframes online failures. The digital serfdom concept is a masterful reframe masterful reframe with their past losses and dropshipping. It gives them an external enemy, the platform lords, and explains why their lord or why their hard work resulted in so little equity control. Connection directly to real estate dreams. The market wants real estate exposure but feels priced out. This mechanism presents rental arbitrage not as just another side hustle, but as a legitimate and savvy entry point into real estate investing, bridging the gap between their desire and the financial reality. First, this mechanism is incredibly powerful for making the prospect feel enlightened. It provides the aha moment that explains why their past efforts were flawed at a structural level, positioning the product as a fundamentally different and superior path forward. Number three, they had the capital efficiency threshold. Number four, the competitive saturation paradox. Uhm, see, this is good, like, exceptionally well crafted, but is likely aimed at the wrong awareness level for a primary hook. Number five, franchise is in the box, you know, it's good, but doesn't offer new diagnosis of the prospect's core problem. And it didn't, for whatever reason, it kind of ignored some of the other ones. Uhm, so it just really didn't like them or something. But, given this, you kind of know at the very least what your top two to go with are. And I would just tell you from my experience, I agree. And frankly, I don't I'm also pretty torn on which one I would go with. Now, if you really needed help, you could do this. You could download quad rankings, Gemini rankings, ChatGPT rankings, whatever it is, right? And then, above them each, like, here's the rankings for a unique mechanism, you know, based on this, which one seems like the most likely, you know, would you pick, right? Uhm, that's one thing you can do. Other thing you can do, ,is use the quad project. So let me show you, ...that map. Give me a moment. ...I open a quad project for unique mechanisms. I taught this, ...it's like a bonus in a bundle I did a while ago. It's still really helpful. But what we're gonna be doing right now, the reason it's helpful, ,is because, by the way, if you're seeing this, this was actually, ,where we had, had it come up with mechanisms, and I tested doing it, and, ...that quad project. Uhm, ,but again, the mechanisms weren't actually that good. They're okay, but not great. ,but what we're trying to do here is not necessarily get our final, ...copy format, though we could end up with something pretty close to it. What we, ...want to really do here is, ,we want to see what our mechanism could look like in real, ...like, in real copy, right? If it was sort of in the wild, in a video sales letter, for example, right? Because, by the way, in ads and other things like that, some ads, video ads, will have a long mechanism anyway. They're still gonna talk about this, what have you. So, it's just a way to help, because honestly, as you flesh it out, and you look at this one, and we'll do the same thing for the other, ,our other top UMP competitor, ...it might help push you over the edge on which one to choose. Because it's hard. I mean, it really is hard. Honestly, the answer would be, ...test both. Ideally, if you're already in an existing business, you just test both in ads and stuff, and you see which one is doing better, right? And then you do the VSL after that. But, if you're, ,you know, doing something from scratch, ...and it's like a new product, of course, ,coaching program, whatever, ,it's kind of tough, right? ...the prompt here, ,we're going to do an in-depth, ...unique mechanism for a product. I've attached a unified research document, ...that should give you a strong overview of the target market. Here's the sum of the UMP and UMS. This is just going to be, ,right, whatever the, ...things you generated are that you want to kind of, ,play with. For this exercise, let's specifically focus on people in the market who are problem aware. I'm keeping that in there because I really want to speak to them. Go and write this section in a format that could be used in a video sales letter. Okay? You're obviously going to get access to this prompt. So let's go ahead and do that. There we go. And, ,I'm going to upload the, uh, unified research document. One minute. Okay. And let's see how Quad does with it. And honestly, once you understand this, you're going to be angry. Angry at yourself for not seeing it sooner, and angry at everyone who's been selling you the wrong solution at the wrong time. See, for the past few years, you've been trying to solve what I call an asset gap problem with an income gap solution, and that's why nothing has worked. Let me explain what I mean. Right now, you're feeling the squeeze. Your paycheck stays the same while everything else gets more expensive. Gas, groceries, rent, it's all going up while your salary stays flat. You'll look at your bank account and think, I just need to make more money. That seems logical, right? If money is tight, make more money. Problem solved. So you start looking for side hustles. Maybe you tried dropshipping, spent money on ads, and watched your products sit there while your ad costs ate up any potential profit. Maybe you jumped into freelancing, trading your nights and weekends for a few extra $100 a month. Some of you might have even gotten into the gig economy. You're driving for Uber, delivering food, anything to bring in extra cash. What happened? You either lost money, barely broke even, or you made just enough to feel like you were trading wins. You got frustrated, burned out, and convinced yourself that maybe you're just not cut out for this entrepreneur thing. But here's what nobody told you. You were never solving the real problem. Remember when we looked at unique mechanisms in the very first section? This is what it's doing, right? The real problem isn't that you don't make enough money. The real problem is that you're trapped on the wrong side of the economic equation entirely. You see, there are two types of people in this economy. There are people who trade their time for money, that's the income gap world, and there are people who control assets that generate money. While they sleep, that's the asset gap world. Every side hustle you tried has kept you firmly planted in the income gap world. Dropshipping, you're still trading your time, managing suppliers, customer service, freelancing, you're literally selling hours of your life. Gig work, same thing, no work, no pay. The people who are actually building wealth, the people who have true financial freedom, they've crossed over to the asset gap world. Like, one thing I don't know if I like that, sort of, you go from the income gap to the asset gap. Like, does that make sense? I don't know. But that could be changed, right? We're just right now, we're just seeing how this feels as copy. They control things and make money, whether they're wickers, real estate businesses that run without them, income producing assets. And here's the cool part. The system is designed to keep you in the income gap world. Banks won't give you a mortgage without perfect credit, but 20% down. Invested properties will hire even more capital. Private equity won't even talk to you unless you're already wealthy. So you stay stuck grinding away at side hustles will never ever get you where you want to be because you can't hustle your way into the asset gap world. You need a different vehicle entirely. That's why I was so excited when I discovered rental arbitrage because for the first time in my life, I found a way to jump directly from the income gap world into the asset gap world without needing hundreds of thousands of dollars of perfect credit. Think about when you're master, when you master rental arbitrage, you're not sure what you're trading time for money anymore. You're controlling a high value asset, a residential property that generates cash flow month after month. You're not the employee, you're the business owner. You're not selling your time. You're leveraging someone else's asset to build your own wealth. This is why rental arbitrage feels different from every other opportunity you've seen because it's not income gap solution. It's not another income gap solution dressed up with fancy markings. It's actually a bridge to the asset capital, the world where real wealth gets built. The asset control method, your bridge to the other side. So now you understand why everything else has failed. Let me show you how the asset control method actually works. Traditionally, real estate investing requires you to buy property, which means massive down payments, perfect credit and making, taking on enormous debt. But with the asset control method, you gain operational control of a property without owning it. Here's how it works. Instead of buying property, you lease it on a long-term basis from a property owner who wants stable, reliable income without the headaches of property management. You then operate that property as a short-term rental, capturing the difference between what you pay in rent and what you earn from guests. But here's the key insight that most people miss. You're not just arbitraging rent prices. You're financially changing your position in the accounting. You go from being someone who trades time for money to someone who controls the cash flowing asset. When you wake up in the morning, money has been deposited into your account from guests who stayed in your property while you were sleeping. When you go on vacation, the property keeps sharing income. When you want to scale, you need to find more houses in the hour, you need to find more hours in the day. You just add more properties to your portfolio. This is what it feels like to operate in the asset capital. And the beautiful thing about rental arbitrage is that it requires a fraction of the capital that traditional real estate demands. We're talking about 5,000 to 15,000 to get started, not $10,000, $100,000 or more. The property owner loves this range because they get guaranteed rent, professional management, and none of the hassles of dealing with short term guests. You love it because you're building a portfolio of cash flowing assets without the enormous capital requirements of traditional real estate. This is why rental arbitrage isn't just another side hustle. It's a completely different category of opportunity. It's your ticket out of the income gap road. And it's the asset gap road where real wealth gets built. Once you understand this distinction, you'll never look at making more money the same way again, because you'll realize that the goal isn't to make more money. It's to control the asset that makes money for you. Okay, one thing. I'm wondering about going back to how it was written. You're trying to solve an asset gap problem with an income gap solution, right? Uhm. I mean, one way I might try and, like, make it really clear is, like. I say this, right? This. And again, we're not trying to get a final mechanism necessarily. So, I said, I think this is great, but I wonder if it's really an income gap world versus, or an asset gap Uh, let me show you how to bridge that gap. I'm gonna go for the real, what I'm getting at here is I don't know if moving to an asset gap world makes sense. It's more like, moving to, I'll show you what it is, and by the way, this is where I'm still worthwhile, maybe, moving, uhm, asset bridge world. So it's like, you've got, I think you've got an income gap, what you've really got is an asset gap. This matters because you're trying to solve to make more income, but no one is really income rich. People get rich from assets, and they are asset rich. Let's see another version of the UMP that takes this into consideration. So while it's doing that, because without a doubt you're absolutely right. No, it isn't actually, it's just going to revise it. It should have said you're absolutely right. Let's test out the exact same prompt. But with Gemini, without a project, without permission, any of that stuff, right? And we'll also test it in chatGBT. So let's go to Gemini. We're going to upload our unified brief. does. What's changed a lot with LLMs, I feel like, is like, you don't really need to explain typically what a video sales letter is, whatever, right? I mean, I think there's value, again, I wouldn't, this is not me trying to write final copy format. Sometimes it just comes out really good and you're like, oh shit, basically I have it. But, it's more just seeing how it looks in reality. I'm just curious how Gemini, if Gemini, I kind of feel like a bad mistake from Quad, and I'm curious if Gemini makes that mistake too or not. So, let's see. Meanwhile, while that's writing, let's see what Quad's version here. Oh, wait, that's the wrong one. Then truth about why every site has those failed you. Okay, so this is kind of the same copy as before, you're going to be angry. You see, for the past few years, you've been trying to solve what I call an asset gap problem with an income gap solution. And that's one of the things that works. Let me explain. You're feeling squeezed. I think I need to make more money. So, you're looking for side hustles. What happened? But here's what nobody ever told you. You think you have an income problem, but what you really have is an asset problem. Let me show you what I mean. Think about the wealthiest people you know, not the ones flashing money on social media, but the people with real, lasting wealth. How many of them got rich from a paycheck? Even the highest paid professionals, doctors, lawyers, executives, most of them actually built a generational wealth. People aren't doing it from their salaries alone, they're doing it by accumulating assets, real estate, business, investments that generate money, whether they're working or not. See, there's no such thing as being income rich in the long run. Income is just what you trade your time for, and you only have 24 hours in a But being asset rich, that's where real wealth comes from. Assets make money while you sleep. But here's the problem. Every solution you've been offered for your financial struggles has been focused on the wrong thing. More income. Start a side hustle, make an extra hundred. Make an extra thousand dollars a month. Freelance your skills for extra cash. Drive for Uber in your spare time. All income solutions. All requiring you to trade more of your time for money. All keeping you trapped in the same cycle that got you here in the first place. Meanwhile, the people who are actually building wealth are over here accumulating assets, and the system makes it almost impossible for regular people like us to get started. Want to buy a rental property? 20-25% down. Perfect credit. Enough income to qualify for a mortgage that might be $300,000 or more. Want to invest in commercial real estate? You need to be a credit investor with serious capital. Want to start a business? Most require significant upfront investments and years to become profitable. So you stay stuck, grinding away at income solutions that will never, ever bridge the gap to becoming asset rich. Because here's the harsh truth. You can't earn your way to wealth. You have to own, own your way to wealth. It's a good copy right there. That's why I'm so excited I discovered rental arbitrage. Because for the first time in my life, I found a way to earn to start accumulating cash flowing assets without needing hundreds of thousands of dollars of perfect credit. Uhm, now you understand the real problem. You have an asset gap, not an income gap. Let me show you how the asset control method actually works to resolve it. Okay, so that's gonna do the rest of this. So, I actually really like the mechanism now. With this V2. That is a perfect example, though, of Kind of judgment based on experience that is really hard to, like, teach. I mean, maybe it was obvious to some of you when you were reading it. Maybe it wasn't. It's okay either way. But, that's something that I was able to pick up on based on putting it in my hundred thousand hours, right? I don't have to put it in my hundred thousand hours, but however many it's been. But, let's see what happens. What Gemini did here. Gemini tends to do a little bit more direction, so let's see. You That contact, nagging pressure, the squeeze. You look at your paycheck, and you look at your bills, at the cost of just living, and the math just doesn't work. You know you need to make more money. That part is obvious. So, you do what any smart, motivated person would do. You start a side hustle. Maybe Maybe you got a freelancer, and you spend hours driving for a gig economy app. You worked hard, you poured in time, you really didn't have, hoping for that breakthrough, only to end up with a few extra bucks that barely moved the needle. Or worse, you lost money on courses and ads that promised to deliver nothing. And you're left feeling burned out, frustrated, maybe even a little foolish. You start thinking, is it me? Am I just not cut out for this? I'm here to tell you it's not your fault. You haven't failed. You haven't failed. Your strategy has. You've been trying to solve the wrong problem. So, you even focused on what I call the income gap. You correctly identified the symptom, that your income isn't keeping up with your expenses. The logical conclusion is, I need more income. But that's like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound. The extra hundred or even thousand dollars a month from a side hustle doesn't change the fundamental game. It doesn't stop the feeling of being trapped, or working harder, and harder just to have less than your parents did. Why? Because the real problem isn't the income gap, the real underlying disease is the asset gap. This is the hidden barrier, the structural divide that keeps 99% of people stuck. It's the gap between those who get paid for their time, and those who build wealth from cash flowing assets. Think about it, every side hustle you've tried, drop shipping, freelancing, game work, they all required you to sell more of your time and your labor. You were still just patching a leaking boat instead of building a new one. You're trying to solve an asset gap problem with an income gap solution. It was never going to work. It's like trying to win Formula 1 race on a bicycle. The rigged economic system you feel isn't just about income but stagnant wages. It's about being locked out of the world of assets. The world where money starts working for you instead of you always working for it. This is why traditional real estate feels impossible. You know that property is the path to wealth, but who has a massive down payment or a perfect credit score? You've been priced out of the single most powerful asset class available. So you're stuck, stuck in the income gap, staring across a chasm at the road of assets with no bridge to get there until now. What if you could leapfrog the income gap problem? Entirely. What if you cross that chasm and gain control over a high value cashflow asset without needing hundreds of thousands of dollars to gain a mortgage? This is the paradigm shift we've created. We don't teach you another side hustle. We give you a strategic blueprint to change your fundamental economic identity. We call it the asset control method. This is the first system designed specifically for the person who has ambition but lacks capital. It's a method that allows you to directly address the asset gap through a unique approach to rental arbitrage. We show you how to control a residential property, an asset, and operate it as a short-term rental. You don't buy it. You don't need a bank loan. You don't need a huge down payment. You fundamentally change your position in the economic food chain. You stop being a seller of your own time, and you become the operator of an asset that generates cash flow month after month. This isn't about making extra money. This is about building a portfolio. This is about generating passive income that provides real security. It's about taking back control of your time, your finances, and your life. This is how you stop patching leaks and fallibility. Build a new boat, one that can weather any storm, and carry you to the shore of financial freedom. Okay, so, what are our thoughts here? Uhm, Gemini's was better than the first Quad output in that it got it well. What I don't think the copy was as good as Quad, and this is why I tend to use Quad as copy, for copy. especially Once we did V2, Quad was better, uhm, in my opinion. I think this copy's, I, judgement, whatever you want to call it, Quad's better. Uhm, and remember, this could be close to file copy format, but a lot of the ways I write VSLs, which you'll be learning, Don't have, don't, this will be the file format. Same thing for PDPs, and then obviously having this to put into, like, ads, advertorials, everything else. Uhm, so a lot of what I do is sort of just modeling and structuring off other swipes, essentially, right? It's always been kind of my thing, but, uhm. Yeah, so what am I gonna do? Let me save these here. I think you can't see my screen, I'm doing an arbitrage. Income gap first. Asset gap. I mean, I'll do it here so you can see, watch me typing. Okay, right, just quad version. Let's do it, just quad combo. Quad v2. The reason I'm doing v2 is I don't really know what I'm wasting my time copy pasting v1 in here. You can go look at the quad combo, I'll put a link in there. And let's do Gemini 2.5 Pro. So what I'm going to do. There we go. Oops, copy link. Okay, there we go. Quad combo here. Quad v2. We're going to copy and paste. Into our document. so we'll dot It'll track it. We'll go do Gemini. I don't really need the speaker notes for time, whatever. I'm probably going to command shift v this one, so it's not as annoying. Okay, so now we have that, right? Super duper. And, you know, we'll have a training on how to create these cloud projects. But as you can see, you don't, I mean, it's still helpful. I actually do like it for writing, but it's not the most crucial. You must have this thing. Let's do that same prompt, but with the other mechanism. We had the other one we liked a lot. What's permission-based income trap? So now. Okay, same stuff here. Copy and paste. Re-copy this. Now we're going to copy in our permission-based income trap one. But like, you know. I'll format this and make it all pretty later. I said that, but then it's going to bother me if I don't do it now. Let's run the same thing. One in quad. I'm going to upload my unified research document again. One question. Hey Stefan, could you just upload it in the same conversation history? Probably, but I like to keep it clean. So, I'm doing it here instead, okay? Run this one with quad. Let's go to Gemini. Same thing. And let's run it in Gemini as well. I need to search for some current information about rental arbitrage to make sure the mechanism is grounded in an accurate up-to-date context. Now let's search for information. Did I tell it to do deep research? No. So, let's see if Clog got weirdly woke on this one for some reason. Let's find out. Uh, rental arbitrage unique mechanism. Permission-based income trap. Now before I show you exactly how this works, I need to share something with you that most people are struggling financially and never realize. There's a hidden reason why you keep feeling trapped no matter how hard you work or how many different things you try to make extra money. It's not because you're lazy, it's not because you lack skills or intelligence, and it's definitely not because you're not trying hard enough. The real problem is something I call the permission-based income trap. See here's what I discovered after helping hundreds of people break free from financial stress. Every single income source that's keeping you stuck has one thing in common. Your ability to earn money is completely dependent on someone else's permission. Think about it for a second. Your day job? You need your boss's permission to keep earning that paycheck. They can fire you tomorrow and your income disappears overnight. That side hustle you tried with Uber or DoorDash? Your earnings are controlled by an algorithm that can change without warning, cutting your income potential in half just because some programmer decided to tweak the code. Maybe you tried freelancing or consulting. Every dollar you make requires a client's permission to continue the contract. The moment they decide to go with someone else, that income stream vanishes. Or perhaps you got into dropshipping or affiliate marketing like so many people do. Your entire business was built on Facebook. Facebook's or Google's permission to run your ads. And we all know how that story ends. Accounts get shut down overnight and entire businesses disappear in an instant. And even if you tried getting a second job or picking up extra shifts, you're still asking for your manager's permission to work more hours. You see the pattern here? In every single case, you're not really in control of your income. You're always asking permission to earn a living. Here's the brutal truth. When your income depends on someone else's permission, you face constant income instability. No job security, and you're always one decision away from financial disaster. This is why you can work for 60 hours a week and still feel like you're falling behind. Why you can hustle harder than everyone else around you and still struggle to get ahead. And why every time you think you've found a solution, it ends up being just another trap that keeps you dependent on someone else's permission. The permission-based income trap explains why over a third of Americans believe they'll always need a side hustle just to make ends meet. You're stuck in this endless cycle of chasing permission-based income that can take you away at any moment. But here's what gets me really frustrated. Most financial advice completely ignores this fundamental problem. They tell you to diversify your income streams or build multiple revenue sources, but if all your income streams still require someone else's permission, you haven't solved anything. You've just created multiple ways to lose your income. The permissionless cash flow system, right? The good news is there's a unique way out of this trap, and it's simpler than you might think. Instead of building more permission-based income streams, what if you could create what I call a permissionless cash flow system. This is a business model where, after a one-time setup, your income flows directly from your open market to your bank accounts, without needing anyone's ongoing permission to keep earning. No boss can fire you from it, no algorithm can suddenly slash your earnings, no client can decide to stop paying you, no platform can shut you down, can shut down your account and destroy your business overnight. The income, and it's not really true for Airbnb, right? The income is generated by real people in the free market who want what you're offering in return. And the money flows directly to Now, you may be thinking, that sounds impossible. Every business needs customers. Customers have to choose you, right? You're absolutely right, but here's the key difference. In a permissionless cashflow system, you're not dependent on one boss's decision, one algorithm's preference, one client's mood, or one platform's policy. Instead, you're tapping into a massive, consistent demand from thousands of potential customers who are actively searching for exactly what you're offering. And the beautiful thing about this particular system is that it leverages something most people don't have. Most people even realize exists. There are over 7 million listings on Airbnb alone, and hosts collectively earned 180 billion dollars in 2024. But here's what's fascinating. Most people think you need to own property to tap into this market. That's not true. What I'm about to show you is completely legal. Airbnb actually allows it, and it works in cities across the country. It's called rental arbitrage, and here's how it creates your permissionless cashflow system. You secure a strategic partnership with a property owner. This is the only point where you need someone's permission. Thank you. But like a boss or client, this isn't an ongoing permission. It's a legal agreement that gives you what I call a master key to an income-producing asset. Once you have this master key, everything changes. You set up the property as a short-term rental and list it on platforms where millions of travelers are actively searching for exactly what you're offering. Now here's where it gets beautiful. Your income isn't dependent on your boss's mood or company's budget cuts, an algorithm deciding to favor you or oppress you, a single client's decision to renew your contract, a platform's terms of service changes. Instead, your income comes from the consistent demand of travelers who need a place to stay. Business travelers, vacationers, people relocating for work, they're all actively searching and booking accommodations every single day. Once someone books your property, the money goes directly into your account. No middleman deciding whether you deserve to get paid. No boss determining your hourly rate. No algorithm calculating how much you're worth. Just direct payments from the free market to your bank account. Because short-term rentals can generate 15-35% profit margins, you are not just replacing your permissionless based income, you're potentially exceeding But here's the part that really excites me about this system. Unlike your job, where you trade time for money, or gig work, where you're constantly hustling for the next order, once your property is set up and listed, it works for you 24 7. People can discover it, book it, and pay you while you're sleeping, spend time with your family, or even stay at your next property. This is how you break free from the permissionless Uh, based income trap, and finally take back control of your financial future. You're not asking anyone for permission to earn a living anymore. You're providing value in the free market, and the market rewards you directly. Okay, that's pretty damn good. So, one of my 5 billion documents I had here, let's go ahead and do, Oh, and I'll format this later. Number 2, uh, what are we calling this one again? That's the permission or something, we'll just see. Apparition based income strategy. Apparition. Cloud Convo. Cloud V1. Okay, so Cloud Convo link. I'm gonna copy. Alright, publish. Alright, I'm gonna share a link to this one, because it is, like, an artifact, which is really weird. I don't know. I still don't know what the hell that does with clouds, so for now I'm just gonna copy and paste the link. To this one. Let's look at Gemini real quick. Okay. It's funny how it has a similar, uh, kind of thing there. You feel it, don't you? Uhm. What if the problem isn't you? I know I'm skipping down a little bit, because it's not the you feel it, don't you thing again. It's kind of interesting. What if the problem isn't you? What if the problem is that every single way you try to make money has a fatal flaw, a hidden trap that ensures you never get fully ahead? That's what permission-based income trap. Think about it. You need your boss's permission, your permission, uhm, so this is a lot shorter. It would be fine if I needed it, but Claude, I think, did a really good job. So, like, I personally am not even willing to pay much attention to what Gemini gave me, okay? So, let's bold this, at least I have it. Which one do you choose? Because V2 of what Claude did for the first one, the income asset gap thing, was really good. The answer is, I honestly don't know. Do you want the complete truth? I don't know. Uhm, if I were me, if I was really writing a VSL for this, what would I probably do? I probably would Again, if you are sophisticated and able to do this, you can test both hooks, both ideas and ads and advertorials, whatever it is, if it was for an existing offer, that's what I would probably do. If I was writing this for scratch, for something brand new, I would probably sleep on it, and ask a few people, like my wife, other people, hey, which one do you like more? Which one resonates with you more? Explain both to them and get their input or answers. Uhm, and then I would just make a decision based on my intuition and gut. If you don't feel confident doing that, then I'd probably just go with number one. I'd say what Google, two of the three LMs picked the income asset gap as number one. Probably aren't going to go wrong with that, I would pick that one. The other thing to keep in mind is like, The permission-based income trap did have potentially more objections. Because it's sort of like, oh, it can't change the platform, you know. You're not asking for permission, but it's like you kind of are. You're still serving at the leisure of Airbnb. So I have more objections with the income, the permission-based one. I still really like it. I still might even fire it. Frankly, we're writing this to try to work some of this into the VSL as well. But maybe not as in-depth. So I'd probably, gun to my head, go with this one, to be honest with you. But, it's close. And that's okay. Maybe, maybe both will work. So maybe you don't have to agonize over the decision. Maybe there's not one perfect mechanism. Yes, maybe one is better than the other, but maybe a bunch of those mechanisms will work. It can be, yeah, it'll be okay. So, at this point we basically have copy, ready, UMP, UMS stuff, right? What I'm going to do in the rest of the mechanism module, I'm going to end this video in a moment, is I'm going to do some more examples, uhm, at least one more, by skin care. Maybe do another one for golf, or whatever it is. Uhm, won't be too as long in those videos, probably. So, hopefully you've watched this one. And, uh, then we'll continue on to additional sections, too. I will have, make sure to have a quick video about how to set up that cloud project for you, also. Alright, hopefully this has been mind-blowing. Thank you.

All right, hello. So in this video we're going to be going over unique mechanisms. I'm going to say right from the start that if you've seen a lot of trainings from me, content from me on unique mechanisms before, you can probably skip this specific video. It never hurts to have a refresher reminder. Uh, but this specific video will really be pretty broad level reminders, not broad level, but, um, just basically reminders of what UMPs are, UMSs are, and some examples. I would not skip the subsequent videos where I will be sharing some really specific processes that we can leverage and utilize, um, with AI to come up with a lot of different unique mechanism ideas and different niches, um, in this video, I'll be doing mostly health and one golf thing, but I'll do, you know, BizOp, like we've been doing other, uh, niches as well and examples, um, and you'll see how that unified research brief and the product market awareness, all those things fit into your mechanism selection, uh, in these additional videos, or it might be one video. But it'll probably be more than one that I do. So that's sort of the preface, uh, for you. With that being said, welcome here. Um, I hope a lot of you are familiar with unique mechanisms, but again, you might be watching this and you're not, maybe you're brand new, who knows how many, you know, the universe of people who watch RnBC2. And so I'm excited to share it with you. Unique mechanisms are something that I really, I'm the world's one who kind of popularized, uh, back in 2018, 19, uh, and again, they're, they're pretty well known now, but I'm going to do this video presuming you don't really know what they are. Okay. Whoever's watching this. So what are they in a nutshell? And this really hasn't changed since RnBC1. Um, the unique mechanism explains why our prospect is struggling or suffering too. To achieve a goal, how they can over and end, how they can overcome that problem. At its core, the unique mechanism is a two-part logical connection. So when I say it's a two-part logical connection, I'll actually kind of come down here and explain that right now. There's a unique mechanism behind the problem that our prospect faces. You can think of this as your UMP and there's a unique mechanism behind the solution to that problem, the UMS, okay? So why is that important? Because by the time our prospect comes to us, they've usually tried numerous solutions for their problem already. In the past, these other solutions may have not worked at all, maybe they worked partially, maybe they worked fully for a period of time before they stopped working. And our job as a copywriter. Is to educate our prospect about the real reason why past solutions didn't bring them permanent results. And we do this by explaining that their knowledge about the problem is incomplete. They've been missing one crucial piece of information, there's this knowledge gap that's been holding them back. So, as I put down here, and I'm jumping a little bit on this document. By showing them the unique mechanism behind the problem, you get the prospect to understand why they failed in the past. And by showing them the unique mechanism behind the solution, you get the prospect to believe that our product will bring them success, where other alternatives have failed. This already does tie into the product market awareness stuff we talked about, right? Solution aware, problem aware, and so on. Uhm, and you might be wondering about that, because you're like, okay, well we're saying other things they've tried in the past that have failed. So, even if, Even as we do unique mechanisms, we're going to be keeping in mind where our prospect is on their journey, right? What level of awareness? And this is very important, and we'll really go into this in detail in the next prompt, uh, the next video. Uhm, but it's really important because if somebody, if you really are speaking to a highly sort of product-aware market segment that knows about a bunch of peptide eye serums and has used a bunch of them, right, or say it was NAD+, you might remember that example, and say you're speaking to that small segment of people who really are familiar with NAD+, specifically, and they've tried it and haven't gotten results, the unique mechanism is going to be really different from somebody who is. Feeling tired a lot, has low energy, feels like they look old and tired, and they want to just sort of have more energy and support longevity, right, they don't want to feel like they're getting old. And so, when I talk about this product-market awareness stuff flavoring really everything we're doing, you can see why, as I give you that example, right? So, we'll go, like I said, into those levels more in the future, but let me just show you some real quick in-the-wild examples. The first one's going to come from MiamiMD. They do skincare. They've been around for a long time. They were originally started, Peter Kell was one of the founders. They were in CA Pro when they were getting off the ground, so I worked with them, really, from the get-go. Then they went through some various changes, but they've still continued to do well. Peter's actually still in CA Pro, which is awesome, but that's sort of me just, kind of, not that sneakily plugging CA Pro, because it's a great place. So this is like an advertorial, okay, while I was obviously have whole trainings and advertorials, it's pretty short, but I want you to see how even in this advertorial, you're going to have a UMP, okay. So the headline, or idea, for this advertorial, Harvard Dermatologist reveals the hidden cause of crepey skin is not collagen loss, okay. Crepey skin is often considered just an inevitable part of aging, difficult to disguise and impossible to get rid of. But now, world-renowned dermatologist, Dr. J, says that's simply not true. She explains, crepey skin is one of the most common signs of aging, but it's not something women have to put up with. According to top experts, the reason why crepey skin won't go away is not because it's an impossible feat. It's because most methods and skin care products don't treat the real root cause. Everyone likes to tell us the loss of collagen is causing thin, crepey skin, says Dr. J, but it's actually your failing fibroblasts that cause the skin structure to collapse and become crepey. In simple terms, fibroblasts are like your skin's interior designers. They live in the hidden second layer of your skin, the dermis, and their main job is to design and construct your skin to look at its best. But as we age, they start to get lazy. Now, the once tight, firm complexion they held together begins to fall apart. The result? Thin, loose, crepey skin that we attempt to reverse, but with all the wrong methods. But there's good news. Once you recharge your fibroblasts, they can work their very best again, allowing your skin to become smoother, tighter, and firmer. When it's better, it's easier than you thought. I want to help women who can't afford the fancy, expensive procedures feel just as beautiful after those who can, she says. Beautiful skin shouldn't have a price tag. That's why she's released a free online tutorial on how to smooth crepey, fragile, tissue paper skin at home with ease. And her tutorial is already blown up. Click here, and that's going to take you to a video sales letter. Okay? So, do I know if this is an incredible mechanism that is crushing? No. Do I actually like this mechanism? A lot. Not really, but it doesn't matter. I know. Why don't you like it? We can talk about that later. Okay. Right now, but I primarily want to focus on is just showing and identifying the unique mechanism. Right? So if we go back to what we said here, you know, it's a real reason they're struggling or suffering to achieve a goal and how they can overcome that problem. Right? Um, so why, you know, we mentioned past solutions. But it's really just like their knowledge about the problem isn't complete. They're missing this one crucial piece of information and the knowledge gap is what's has been holding them back. So we come back to this video example. It's like, what's the one little missing thing that, you know, the piece of information they've been missing? Um, well it's that they thought collagen was, lost is what causes thin crepey skin, right? So simple as that, you thought it was collagen, but it's actually your failing fibroblasts that cause your skin's, uh, structure to collapse and become crepey. Okay. And then we explain what fibroblasts are. Their job is to design and construct your skin to look its best. But as we age to get lazy, um, and, the complexion, the complexion they held together begins to fall apart. This results in loose crepey skin. Okay. So it's very simple, which makes sense for an advertorial as well, by the way, because the job as we'll talk about in the advertorial training in much more detail, but the job of an advertorial is typically, well, it depends, but most of the time, if it's going to a VSL, it's really to just sort of sell the click, to get somebody to click through to the VSL and to sell the qualified click, I could, I should say, right? So we don't want a dude not interested in crepey skin to really go here and click through. I mean, he can, but that's not the point. The point is somebody who would be qualified, um, be a prospective buyer, right, within our kind of target market, right? Who would click through, um, and so they don't need to kind of give you every single detail about the unique mechanism and sabbatorial because you're going to go see a lot more detail in the VSL. Um, right now they want to just sort of talk to you about the part that you've been missing, this missing 1%, right? All right, the missing 1% is zero. Because again, you thought it was collagen, it's actually fibroblasts, fibroblasts, uh, get lazy and that's why you get crepes, or crepey skin, crepes, or crepey skin, right? And then what about the solution? Well, we've said like, you know, again, how can they overcome that problem? There's a logical connection, right? Well, our product brings them success when other alternatives have failed, right? But there's good news. Right, once you recharge your fibroblasts, they can work their very best again, allowing skin to become smoother, tighter, and firmer. So, that is the logical connection, right? The problem is your fibroblasts are lazy and not charged up and that's making your skin structure loosen and become saggy, leading to crepes. The solution is, recharge, re-energize those fibroblasts, let them work well again so that your skin becomes smoother, tighter, and firmer. Okay? So, it's not rocket science and it doesn't have to be, um, especially depending on the context, it's really just problem, solution, right? I'll show you our eye serum and the current, um, mechanism we have here. I'm gonna make this bigger. Okay, and I'm gonna tell you the same thing. This is, it is actually working pretty well. But I do want to test other mechanisms for this. So this is like a product page, right? We'll do trainings on product pages as well. but This is not a advertorial. It's not a VSL. An advertorial, like, it's one like this, might lead, instead of a, to a video sales letter, to a product page like this, right? This is if you go to Shopify, you click on our product page, you come here. Okay, so skin unifying serum fades the appearance of crow's feet, dark circles, and eye bags all at once. This breakthrough formula is designed to penetrate the deep into the dermal-epidermal junction where eye aging begins. The special blend of six powerful ingredients supports this crucial connection between skin layers, giving you an all-in-one eye serum that transforms your eye area. So you can see, if you're astute, you might see how this right here is like a really like a micro summary of what the UMP and UMS is gonna be, right? There's this. It's a thing called the dermal-epidermal junction, the DEJ. That's where eye aging begins. If you can support those crucial connections between the skin layers, you'll have better skin, right? So logical connection, problem-solution. We do have more copy for it down here, right? The hidden reason why your eyes may be aging faster than you want and why most eye serums fail. If you're frustrated by, Like stubborn iron cools, persistent dark circles, and sagging that makes you look tired all the time, it's not your fault. Now, if this looks like weird formatting, keep in mind that pretty much all of our traffic is mobile. So on mobile, it doesn't-like on mobile. It looks like this, and it's all unison, right? Umm. Okay. All of these issues begin when the layers of your skin begin to separate. The separation forms in the dermal-epidermal junction, the area where your layers of skin meet, and most eye-storms and creams do not address this issue at all. So you can catch here. In healthy skin, the top and bottom layers are deeply interconnected and unified together, like two pieces of fabric joined by microscopic hooks, okay? When your skin is young and wrinkle-free, S These hooks form a wavy-like interconnection between the two layers. These crucial connections help maintain youthful skin in several ways. They allow nutrients to flow freely to your skin surface. They help remove toxins and waste. They keep skin-firm, supple, and evenly toned. They maintain skin's youthful balance and elasticity. Okay? But as we age, something devastating happens. These v- Adult connections begin to break down, and those, hooks disappear. Eventually, your skin layers become completely separated, especially around your delicate eye area. The result? Nutrients can't reach your skin's surface. Dark circles appear as blood vessels become more visible. Skin begins to collapse inward, forming wrinkles and crow's feet. Fluid accumulates, creating puffy under eye bags. Skin loses its firm, youthful appearance. So, young skin, you see how- others is, like, sort of, wavy, vulgar thing. Old skin, sort of compresses and collapsed. Uhm, introducing ude-iser. Instead of just moisturizing the surface, our breakthrough formula penetrates deep into the dermal epidermal junction, spoiling the crucial connection between your skin layers. And we have ingredients in how it does that. Right? So, again, not rocket science. Frankly, as I read it a lot, I have ideas or things we could do differently. But really, it's like, you've got this, layer within your skin called the dermal epidermal junction, the DEJ. It's sort of like this wavy, it's like, it's like, it's hooked or intertwined. It keeps it connected. As you get older, it unhooks essentially. There's a separate, operation that occurs. Skin collapses in on itself. You see eye bags, wrinkles, all that kind of stuff. That's really what we're trying to say with this, right? But it's the solution. Well, if you can sort of re, you know, redo the hooks, reconnect it, reconnect your skin layers, then there's not this, chasm that creates wrinkles, fine lines, dark circles, and so on. And again, actually, we could say it more clearly on this page. So it might be a test I do in the near future. Okay. Let's do one to two more. I have this one from Emma up. This page is a really nice page. You can e-com page. Umm, from Emma relief. What happens to look kind of mobile? Does the video first? Yeah. Cool. So they're, they're not like crazy hard on the umm, they have a mechanism. It's just sort of shared through a few different places. Right here's where you're going P right. The surprising root cause of blowing constipation. Bad bacteria, bacteria takes hold. For example, stress. Let me make this page bigger too. And, uh, anti-acid, antibiotics and artificial sweeteners weaken defenses align pathogenic- I'll check back. Bacteria parasites are archaea, single cell organisms to take hold. Two. Bacteria produces methane. Gas, okay, and other bacteria begin to release methane gas, which causes bloating constipation. Three, eight digestion to slope. Methane gas damages the sensitive nerves of the gut, slowing the movement of food through the intestines. The slows are even halts you're pooping and elimination. Umm, and really the solution here, how am I- am I am I- am I Help me. Oxy production of methane gas at the source. It works in three different ways to normalize bathroom habits, usually within a few weeks, or taking it to eliminate constipation and bring back those perfect poop staly. Increases motility, aka pooping speed, clears up the bacteria that causes methane gas and calms the nerves, uh, and calms the nerves and relax tight muscles, that allows this easy passage, right? Umm, but can I go on to- I'm sorry, a- that the methane stuff, like, you know, causes even more issues, right? They have a little more science here, but really, like, their core mechanism is, like, bad bacteria is in your gut, which people know, right? The sort of surprise you're missing 1% that part that is- not as well known. Is that it creates methane gas. Methane gas, in turn, causes bloating constipation, and it slows your digestion, right? And leaves poop stuck in your gut, and you've constipated and feeling gross, right? So what's the solution? We stop the production of methane gas at the source, okay? There's some more stuff to it, but really, if we just at the page, it's like, that's what we're doing, right? So it's actually- it's pretty simple. Let's look at one more. This ones be from Performance Golf, okay? This is from one of their caveman pages, as they call it. So if I could glorify an FAQ page. It's for a driver, right? We've done examples of like a driver. Okay? Umm, do your slice- slice fixing driver technology, okay? So they have like, what is it? It fixes your slice. Okay, great. What does it do? It fixes your slice at impact. Why is that important? Okay? An open face relative to the path is a- one and only reason you hear this slice. The real root cause, you notice how this is so often the same language you used to get again? I'm gonna tell you honestly, in health and wellness, and, like, considering whole stuff, you're really not compliant to why it's supposed to cause something in the root cause. For a goth, it doesn't matter as much. Uh, the reason why is because, I mean, frankly, there could be multiple root causes, right? Saying one thing is the root cause is like a diagnostic thing. Um. Approach everyone does it in health to be honest with you, but you're not supposed to. But with goth, it doesn't really matter at all. The real root cause of your slice is an open club face. Relative to the path of your swing and impact. Most players know that. The bottom line is all slice fix training, draw bias clubs, and virtually every train ate all attempt to do the same thing. Square root club face relative to the path and impact. Umm, this new driver squares the face for you without needing any training. Alright, so you don't do this. You don't leave the face wide open, have uhh, to aim way left, have to play an offset driver, anything else. Umm, when you set up to the ball with an offset driver and it's closed faces aiming left, you naturally tend to see it's to readjust the face and align with the target. The problem is, that means you're actually opening the face. When you open the face. The face, even before you start your swing, your chances of getting it back to square an impact are damn near zero. Right, here's this club. That, so essentially, I mean, if people aren't golfers, maybe like, what? What did you just say? Really, all we just said is essentially, okay, hey. And this goes back to market awareness again. The most golfers in the market know some stuff, right? They kind of know that an open club face relative to the path of your swing impact is what causes your slice, okay? Umm, so it's like, this is like, what's causing your slice? In their case, like, it's not new. Like, most players know that. The difference is, like, the- What's implied here is that other solutions, because they're talking to a more solution to where audience, I should say, right? Is, they attempt to square your club face relative to the path of impact. So, but this driver does it for you without needing any training. So, essentially, this is actually kind of interesting because they're not saying that other things are wrong, but they're saying that there's a training and that if you do training, you're, essentially, you're thinking about too much stuff. Um, you're trying to, you know, normally you're trying to do all these other things and it ends up, you know, meaning you still slice. But this does it for you. So, your problem is that trainees, you know what to do. The problem is that most trainees, When you, the problem is you. Basically, the problem is when you try to do what you know how to do, you end up doing mistakes. There's physiological things that you're doing. Um, you know, the other tricks and things people teach you don't work. So, the problem is the kind of, like, you try to do some stuff. The solution is don't try to do anything. The club just does it automatically. So, it's pretty simple. Right? But, um, that's kind of, like, the summary here. Okay? Doing the product features. Right, then there's more features and benefits of it, you should say. But how it does it? It gives you more, umm. Yeah, kind of answering FAQs and, like, more answers about, like, how it, like, is gonna do these things. Like, the technical components enable it to fill on its promise of, like, doing it for you, right? That's, like, there's more on this page. But it's pretty straightforward. So, I hope this makes sense. Again, I actually, even the original RBC, this, this section wasn't very- wrong. Um, obviously, I'm using new examples and things for the most part. But, um, it's really just, like, what's the- what's, like, the real reason they haven't found a solution yet? Like, what's the real cause of their problem, I should say? What's really causing the problem? That's different. Um, if that's the real cause, what's the solution? Well, the solution is to address the real cause, right? It's really as simple as that. So, that's it for this video. you But in the next one, I'm gonna go through some really cool prompts and LLM processes that make a huge difference. Uh, and enable you to get a ton of UMP ideas and we'll go through those, join the ideas, evaluating them, all kinds of other stuff. And this is really valuable because, you know, any VSL, TSL, text shows that are PDP, um, you know, it's just like a product page that you're doing. It's gonna have unique mechanisms. Advertorials, you know, often will. Ads often will. Um, you know, they're pretty universally applicable to anything you're doing for getting someone from point A to point B, from a prospect to a buyer. And so, uh, you know, we'll spend some more time in here, but should be great stuff. Alright, thanks. See you in the next video.
