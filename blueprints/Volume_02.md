**O que acontece**: What Has Their Experience Been Like? It‚Äôs a mixed bag ‚Äì full of trial and error. Many women have spent years (and considerable money) experimenting with anti-aging products. Small victories are common: e.g. finding a moisturizer that makes skin feel plumper or a serum that gives a ‚Äúglow.‚Äù One woman reported that after revamping her regimen, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed a big difference! ‚Ä¶even if I‚Äôm the only one who notices‚Äùreddit.comreddit.com ‚Äì simply doing something proactive gave her a positivity boost. Women often say skincare helps them feel in control. They also share tips: using sunscreen and hats diligently has helped some fade their sun spots over timereddit.comreddit.com. However, frustration is equally common. Many over-the-counter creams don‚Äôt live up to the hype. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve probably tried a few anti-aging creams. Some may help a little, but many‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt penetrate deep enough to trigger real change,‚Äù one article noted, reflecting the experience that ‚Äúsurface-level‚Äù products are only modestly effectiveanationofmoms.com. Women in forums often lament spending a lot on high-end creams with negligible results. On the procedure side, experiences range from elation to regret. Those who use Botox generally report satisfaction in the short term ‚Äì it does smooth wrinkles ‚Äì but it‚Äôs temporary and needs repeating every 3‚Äì6 monthscentracare.com. A frequent comment is that Botox or fillers ‚Äúwork, but you have to keep it up.‚Äù Some feel empowered by low-invasive treatments: ‚ÄúNo injections. No appointments. Just a few sessions a week‚Ä¶ and my skin looks more alive,‚Äù said a mid-40s woman who preferred an at-home deviceanationofmoms.comanationofmoms.com. On the other hand, negative experiences include skin irritation from harsh products (retinol can cause dryness and peeling at first, for example), or disappointment when even expensive procedures didn‚Äôt meet expectations. In their own words, ‚Äúthis s**t is hard‚Ä¶ I really thought I was going to skate through this whole thing gracefully!‚Äùreddit.com ‚Äì i.e., aging caught them off guard despite trying to prepare. Many also experience psychological conflict in using these solutions: they enjoy the confidence boost of looking better but worry about ‚Äúgoing too far.‚Äù One commenter observed her 42-year-old sister bouncing from Botox to fillers to saving for an eye lift, and fretted ‚Äúshe is just perfect [as she is], but I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôll one day go too far or deal with the wrong surgeon‚Äùreddit.com. Thus, their experience is often a cycle of hope -> limited result -> try something new, with a growing realization that aging is an ongoing process to ‚Äúmanage‚Äù rather than one magic fix.

Is There a Conspiratorial Story Behind Why Old Solutions Didn‚Äôt Work? Some women do entertain conspiracy-tinged narratives about anti-aging solutions ‚Äì especially in the context of copywriting or alternative health circles. A common trope is that ‚Äúbig skincare‚Äù or ‚Äúbig pharma‚Äù is hiding a cheap, natural cure for wrinkles to protect their profits. For example, you might hear a story that a certain inexpensive ingredient or plant extract was discovered to dramatically reduce wrinkles, but because it couldn‚Äôt be patented, major companies buried the research. Whether true or not, these stories circulate in marketing for new products. An illustrative (though fictional-sounding) example: during WWII, U.S. Army doctors supposedly found a compound (say, a rare herb or acid like undecylenic acid for fungus, as in the prompt‚Äôs example) that also had skin benefits, but it was forgotten after the war. In copywriting lore, one might spin that ‚Äúthe surgeon general‚Äôs secret anti-fungus formula also made soldiers‚Äô skin baby-smooth ‚Äì but after the war it was shelved‚Ä¶ until now!‚Äù Such conspiratorial stories are appealing to this demo because it suggests the solution was out there all along. Another storyline: ‚ÄúAncient remedy suppressed‚Äù ‚Äì e.g., perhaps ancient women used a certain tree oil to stay youthful, but modern cosmetic companies favor lab chemicals instead because they‚Äôre cheaper to mass-produce. There‚Äôs also a bit of conspiratorial thinking around the beauty industry‚Äôs motives: some women believe these companies actually want consumers to have to keep using products (so nothing is allowed to be one-and-done effective). They might say ‚ÄúIf a cream truly permanently fixed wrinkles, they‚Äôd go out of business ‚Äì so of course they don‚Äôt make it‚Äù. Likewise, a few suspect that some anti-aging products can even cause dependency ‚Äì for instance, the idea that your skin ‚Äúgets addicted‚Äù to certain creams or that stopping a product makes your skin worse than before (sometimes true with corticosteroid creams or certain actives). This fuels a mild conspiracy belief that companies design products that treat symptoms but not the cause, keeping women on the hook for lifevox.com.

Hello, hello. Alright, so here and now I want to show you how to create a unified research document. All we're doing in this section is taking the different research pieces we've pulled thus far around product and market awareness, competitive research, and psychographic research, then we are going to feed them into Clod and create one very simplified document that we can use as we go to generate various forms of copy with LLMs. This will make sense, I think, as you look at it from a perspective of, okay, that's very simple, but as we go through processes for generating copies, and especially longer form copy, it'll be even clearer how and why this is important. But right now, I want to show you the prompt and a couple of examples, and we're actually going to troubleshoot one because it might come up for you, and I think that would be valuable. So, you'll see I have one successful example, and you'll see, know, here I don't have a successful example, and we'll make it successful, and I'll kind of show you what I mean. Okay, the prompt is pretty simple. I'm working on a marketing campaign and niche, the product is product, and we focus on customers and region. Now, I don't have this highlighted, and the reason why is because you can honestly just copy and paste it in as is most of the time. You'll see that in a moment. So far, I have performed research around product market awareness levels, competitors, and psychographic research. I'm going to upload several PDFs that contain this research. What I want you to do is go through these PDFs in depth and then create one unified research brief that contains all of the key elements that would be needed in order to successfully implement this campaign. Specifically, this will be a unified document that I'll share with you and other LLMs for background information and context as we generate additional copy and marketing assets, most of which will be direct response oriented. I don't need information on TAM size or even specific strategies that were included in these deep research reports. Instead, what I really need are the following. Target market demographic overview. Here I put focus on people who fall into the problem aware and solution aware market segments primarily. This could be changed. I have it because we're giving this broad document with the different market segments. We need to tell it which segments to focus on. So the first example I'm going to be doing is like eye serum. So I have it here. But as you'll recall from that product market awareness training, if you watched it in depth and I really think it was one of my favorite trainings I've done in recent years, um, if I was doing GLP-1 medications, I'd be like solution aware people probably, right? If I was doing bizop, I could might just go problem aware and even unaware, you know, because you could speak to those people. So most of the time it's going to be in here, but you may want to change that contextually based on what you've learned. Okay, target market psychographic overview. What are their problems and pain points? I have examples. I just pulled these from like a weight loss. I think it's from Bye. It's kind of dimensionalized pain points, right? So these are just examples for Claude, you know, embarrassed, shamed, humiliated about their weight. Again, it might seem like aggressive or negative language, but the reality is it won't matter too much. And you'll see that as we continue on, okay? What are their hopes and dreams? Specifically, what does their ideal future state look like where their problem has been solved? What would that look like? How would they look and feel when they dream and imagine this future? What else is true about their life at this point? Um, I didn't really need that parenthesis there. Actually, I guess it was supposed to be... How do they view themselves more broadly? What language should What language should we avoid? What are the primary promises we can make to them and that they would want to hear when it comes to solving their pain points? Here's an example. It's again from like a weight loss, some aggressive weight loss offer, but it does not matter. I promise. As far as they can feel like, oh, I'm not gonna, that's too aggressive. Like, don't worry about it. It's not, it won't be too aggressive for whatever you have. There's a million reasons why that's true. Just trust me for now. What will their biggest objections be to our marketing campaigns for our product? And how can we address those? What existing solutions has the market tried already? Why are those existing solutions not adequate enough? Now, I'm going to tell you something that's really super honestly. I'm going to show you like a quick and dirty process, um, in the VSL section. And frankly, probably for all the sections where you can essentially show, if you have something you're modeling off of like another VSL or other product pages or advertorials or whatever it is, um, you can, especially VSLs, you can conceivably shortcut a lot of this research and still get good copy. Again, like I mentioned this in another video, I would still, in a perfect world, do the research, understand the market better. Um, but, that's true, right? So, to be honest with you, I generally, use these processes that I've shared, especially the psychographic one, um, a lot. The product market awareness one, recently, a lot, because I realized how important it was, like I spoke to, um, you know, in that video. And the competitor one, I haven't used as much, but I like it, and I'm starting to use it more, right? So, I'll be, I'll be candid with you about how I use these processes. I don't really have, like, a unified one before, I didn't have, like, a unified one I always did, so I kind of created this prompt for RMBC, but I know what the end result looks like, I know what kind of outputs I'm trying to get, and I know my, you know, I do have, like, a very proven process for all the copy generation and everything like that. So, this is not just being done completely arbitrarily, like, oh, like, let me just give you some random ass process, it's like, this is being done to get to a future, you know, to a list of outputs that are going to be valuable to you for certain as you go about things, okay? I share all that because I want to show you a couple of things as I was experimenting here. The first time, I believe it was, uhm, this is the untitled one, doesn't work. It's not going to show, Huh. Okay, it might, Was it No, okay. Well, I guess I, maybe I deleted the other one, but essentially what you're gonna see, uhm, or what I would show you is before I added, uhm, 1, 2, 3, 4, I kind of tried this prompt, uhm, and the thing it gave me was too much, and I was like, oh, the TAM is this size, and this is the market size, and the growth is here, and here's the revenue, and, like, all this shit that, like, I don't need to write direct response copy. It's good knowledge to have as a marketer, but not for a direct response copy. So I added this stuff in. I also originally had a number 5 that was, like, anything else, which you'll see here, uhm, and I realized, oh, you know what, I don't actually need that either. But, anyway, this is, like, the prompt, okay? I put this in the clod. You'll see I had 5, and anything else is relevant. I actually removed that after testing this, because I don't think I need it, okay? So, alright, so, what I did then is I took, basically, 4 PDFs. I took and I'm actually going to show you What is it For iSerum, I took, I will number these, you know, later, but I basically took the product market awareness document, I took the competitor summary from Gemini, um, I took the psychographic research summary that clod had done, the unified summary, we did that in the previous module, And I added in the additional descriptive language to have that, too. Those are the four I put, right? So I uploaded those four PDFs, ran the niche, er, the prompt, as you'll see, I said, in niche, product is product, we focus in Didn't really matter. Target market demographic overview, core demographics, ages 35, 60+, peak target, 40, 55. Primarily Gemini. Generation X and younger baby boomers. Income, middle to upper middle, middle class or disposable income for premium skincare. Life stage, peak earning years, often sandwiched generation, caring for children and aging parents. Role, self-appointed chief medical officer of household with sophisticated medical and nutritional literacy. Digital behavior, um, problem-aware searches broadly, how to get rid of dark circles, under-eye wrinkles, cause of puffy searches, specific solutions, best eye cream, anti-aging cream, eye cream for dark circles. Active on Facebook, increasing on TikTok, Instagram for beauty content. Shopping, heavy reliance on online reviews, comparison shopping, value social proof over celebrity endorsements. Let's pause for one moment here. Why would these things be visible? Well, if you're doing advertorial or a VSL or even an ad and you're speaking to an from a, like, even whether you're telling your story or you're just speaking to somebody or you're sharing some of the journey, like talking about reviews, right? Like I was kind of, I was skeptical, but I saw all their online reviews. Um, I compared it to the competitors, right? Um, I just saw a lot of real people all saying that this was a product that really helped, right? Having that kind of language that you use would be helpful, right? Same thing with when I looked on Facebook or Instagram or TikTok, right? But, um, that'd be helpful too. Okay. So target market, psychographic overview, core problems and pain points, physical and visual concerns. Sudden, seemingly overnight appearance of wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness, skin texture changes, dryness, dullness, and loss of glow, multiple contradictory issues simultaneously, dryness, acne, wrinkles, previous skincare routines suddenly stop working, looking tired and older than they feel inside. Emotional and psychological pain, shock and betrayal. I wake up one day, look in the mirror and notice something new, a line where there wasn't one before. Identity crisis, feel like they're getting a new body, face, brain in a bad way and don't recognize themselves. Loss of confidence, no longer turning your head and it's taking longer to get ready, avoiding photos. Societal pressure, living in a cult of youth culture that devalues aging women. Financial frustration, spending significant money on products that don't work. Medical dismissal, feeling abandoned by a healthcare system during perimenopausal menopause. Social media anxiety, constant comparison to filtered unrealistic beauty standards. Practical frustrations, I have zero clue what to trust and which reviews online to believe. Product sensitivity, reactions, burning, irritation from potent ingredients. Time constraints, balancing work, family, and self-care. Information overload, overwhelmed by conflicting skincare advice. Hopes and dreams, ideal future state. Visual transformation, refreshed appearance, looking as young as they feel inside. Natural radiance, skin that glows and looks alive without heavy makeup. Smooth, plump skin, reduction in fine lines and restoration of firmness. Bright, rested eyes, no longer over-the looking, perpetually tired. Confidence in bare skin, comfortable going makeup-free. Emotional empowerment, self-assurance, I feel confident, I feel powerful, I feel good in my skin. Control over aging, managing the process gracefully rather than feeling victimized by it. Professional relevance, maintaining career advancement and respect. Personal fulfillment, pursuing new adventures and growth opportunities. Balanced life, successfully managing family care while prioritizing self-care. Lifestyle vision, effortless beauty routine, simple, effective products that actually work. Financial wisdom, investing in quality products that deliver results, not wasting money on false promises. Social confidence, feeling attractive and relevant in social situations. Active lifestyle, keeping up with family activities and personal interests. Language and communication style, use this language. Empowering, support, nourish, strengthen, restore, revitalize. Scientific but Accessible, clinically proven, dermatologist tested, peptide technology. Validating, you deserve, it's time, you've earned this. Realistic, gentle yet effective, visible results, gradual improvement. Quality focused, premium ingredients, proven formulations, expert developed. Avoid this language, ageist, anti-aging, turn back time, fountain of youth. This is questionable, we'll talk about that later. Uhm, desperate, miracle, instant transformation, overnight results. And these are all actually sort of questionable, but it's interesting. Shame-based, hide, fix, flawless, imperfections. Overly clinical, complex, chemical names without explanation, youth obsessed, reference to looking 20 again or competing with a younger woman. Primary promises that resonate, efficacy focused promises, visibly reduced crow's feet, fine lines and under eye puffiness in 4-8 weeks. Restore skins, natural firmness, natural firmness and elasticity around the delicate eye area, clinically proven peptide technology that rebuilds collagen from within, gentle yet powerful formula safe for sensitive skin, professional grade results without the professional price tag or irritation. Emotional transformation promises, look as refreshed and vibrant as you feel inside, regain confidence in your natural makeup-free skin, feel in control of your skin's aging process, experience the peace of mind that comes with a product that actually works. Reclaim your time with a simple, effective routine that fits your busy life. Lifestyle enhancement promises, skip the concealer, eyes that look naturally bright and rested, professional presence that commands respect and attention, confidence to pursue new opportunities and adventures, freedom from the endless cycle of trying and discarding ineffective products, investment in yourself that your future self will thank you for. Primary objections on how to address them, I've tried everything, nothing works. Objection, no. Deep skepticism from years of disappointing products, address the lead of clinical studies before or after photos, and detailed explanations of peptide technology differences. Uh, it's too expensive, it'll irritate my skin, peptides are marketing hype, I don't have time for complicated routines, my dark circles are generic, are genetic, existing solutions and their inadequacies. I didn't read all the things, but like, I'm just trying to show you, like, this is a really nice piece of context to have and to give to an expert. LLM as you go to generate copy, and hopefully you can see that. The thing I want to talk about too before I get to the existing solutions is when we talk about avoiding the nuance here, and I'll have to probably talk about more in another module, is that there's a couple of nuances, right? This is why I'm always saying you do need to be a critical thinker still, even with LLMs, they get you 99% of the way there, most of the time, 95% of the way there, for sure, right? But, instant transformation, if you're selling like an instant eye lift, like, you know, you put on and it instantly lifts your eyes, then it would be an instant transformation with overnight results. So I might still speak to that, even if it says to avoid it, right? Uhm, something here, what's 16 and 48 weeks, like, yeah, but if. You got faster results, I would talk about faster results, right? Uhm. Reference to looking at 20 again, like, I think, you know. It's an interesting experiment, like, it probably makes sense, but, it also, it, it. You have to kind of think about the mental state of who you're selling to. And there's different emotional states, and we'll talk about that in another training. So, overall, I think this is really good, but I would just be critically thinking about that, and we'll talk more about it in a future training on emotional states, or whatever it is, okay? What have they tried, right? Mass-market eye creams, why they're not adequate enough. Prestige department store brands, the ordinary budget actives, professional treatments, high-end miracle cures, things with DIY natural remedies. So, why is this valuable? In the vast majority of copy, you're kind of talking about alternative solutions and dismissing them as not being adequate, right? Like, why can't, an obvious immediate objection, in addition to these ones, is always gonna be like, like, well, either I tried other products and they didn't work, or I tried other products and I'm pretty happy, why should I switch to your product? Or, what makes your product better than other products? Or, how is this different? And part of how we handle that is a unique mechanism, but another part of how we handle that is just, you know, addressing competitors and then dismissing them, right? So, there's that. And then five, I didn't think this was really, It's fine, but like, Like, you know what I mean? I don't need to give an L on this to write copy. Like, I don't think I need to give an L on this, so that's why I removed number five, okay? So, I want to do the same example for the Airbnb arbitrage space we have, right? Uhm, but when I hit go, it's saying your maximum image count, so I'm like, well, I don't really know what that means, to be honest with you. So, I'm gonna open a new Google document here, come over here for a minute. So, let's go back to Deep Research, Product Market Awareness, and let's go to Gemini. Here's Airbnb Arbitrage. The thing I'm gonna do that I think will work, we'll find out here, is I'm gonna copy all this, Ctrl-A, if you're on a Mac, or, sorry, Ctrl-A to select all. Basically select all, copy, I'm gonna paste into this document. Actually, sorry, what I'm gonna do is, with Mac, at least, it's Command-Shift-V, which is an unformatted version of this. So, it's gonna be harder to read. But, you don't need to read it, the LM needs to read it, right? Then I'm also gonna probably go look at all these links that were cited here. I'm gonna move all that to not overwhelm quad. Actually, that's better, I'm gonna do, you know, Unified Research Doc Airbnb. Actually, I'm not gonna do it. For Unified Research Doc Airbnb Arbitrage Example Then I'm gonna download that as a PDF so I can upload it to quad. Give me one moment, I'm gonna make sure I do this accurately over here. Alright, so that one I have now. I'm gonna go to Competitor Research, Airbnb Arbitrage. I have Gemini and I have Chat GPT. I'm gonna open Gemini's. Same thing, I'm gonna CTRL-A, CTRL-C, I'm gonna make a copy, this is gonna be easier to do that. This is a 485 research doc, blah blah blah, competitor, research, Gemini. Replace this, with this one, uhm, so basically I just copy and pasted CTRL-SHIFT-V again, Airbnb stuff in here, complete the work, cite it, so there's no images. But basically if you do CTRL-SHIFT-V, uhm, or CMD-SHIFT-V, or whatever it is on Microsoft, you're basically just pasting with no, uh, images, uh, like, or photos. Right? Which means it's just plain text, which is gonna be better. So I'm gonna download this one as a PDF, okay? Uhm, in this case, I also put, we did Perplexity, and we did ChatsCPT. I'm gonna stick with ChatsCPT here. I'm gonna go ahead and take this, I'm gonna make another copy, We'll call this one, example, uh, ChatsCPT. We'll replace it with the ChatsCPT stuff, which again has been, Thank you. Formatted here, let's make sure we're in the ChatsCPT one. Okay, cool. And then similarly, I'm going to And I'm going to download it as a PDF. Now you can do the same thing for the Perplexity one. I don't think Perplexity one was that good, Perplexity one was that good, so I'm going to skip it. I'm going to go to Psychographic Research, Airbnb Arbitrage, I've got my Clod Summary document. In this case, I know it was just a copy and paste from Clod, so there's not really any images here I need to worry about because Clod didn't generate images, so I'm going to download as a PDF. And I'm going to put all those into a little folder on my computer. Now, we are going to try this prompt again with those documents. I'm going to delete these ones. These are the only old ones. I'm going to upload from, uh, the plain text version. So give me a moment. Alright, it's uploading. Hopefully this works because it's, uh, hopefully there's just some weird images embedded in the copy and paste from ChatsDBT or something like that. So, this isn't my troubleshooting thing, okay? It'll take a minute for them to upload because there's a lot of PDFs, a lot of pages. Let's stretch it out. Alright, come on, Claude, you can do it. It could also just be Claude sucking, which it does do sometimes. It's really taking a long time. It shouldn't be that long. There we go, okay. Let's see if it works now or if Claude is still being a jerk. Okay, looks like it's gonna work now. Okay, nope. Why did the image count? I really wonder. By the way, I did take the other documents and put them into Gemini, but the unified document was just not that good, right? Uhm, another thing you could do is test using poe.com. Give me a moment here. So, poe.com. is like an aggregate thing, right? Honestly, Claude would probably be fine, but let me. What's it? This is all showing. Let's see. So, I'm going to copy and paste that same prompt Sorry, one second. Alright, this is the same prompt. I put these four documents here. Let's see if I get the same error, or if it works using Quad4 through Poe. And I know this is kind of annoying, but this is sort of how you have to work with LMs as it stands currently sometimes. Let's see. So far, it says it's thinking. Okay. And now it's doing it. So, what I wonder about, to be honest with you, is I don't know if that was a really too much for Quad, because obviously it's doing it here in Poe. Or, sometimes Quad, to be honest with you, especially with Quad4, just gets, like, overwhelmed. There's too many inquiries going. It's really the one downside to Quad. And it'll be like, you'll do one thing and it'll be like, oh, you're out of prompts, or you're out of limits, or, oh, like, it'll give you some bullshit reason why Quad isn't, like, able to do what it's supposed to do. And usually, if you come back in an hour or two and try it, Quad will work. But, you can also, obviously, use a tool like Poe. I think it's, like, $20 a month. And it's kind of good to have as a backup. I use this also with Copy as well, when needed, and all that kind of stuff, right? So now, uhm, we can look at, sort of, the segments, right? I did include, I still said Problem Aware and Solution Aware. Let's do a breakdown here. Demographics, Middle Class, Employment Status, U.S. Based, uhm, I think Education is Questionable and College, right, whatever, Core Archetypes, Core Problems and Pain Points. So now, it's doing a really good job, right? I'll make sure to include this output. You can go through it in detail, uhm, like, figure it out in the next video, and I'll see you in the next video. Ability to quit their job forever or escape the corporate grind. Multiple income streams provide financial security and independence. Building a legacy and ensuring their children's financial security. Lifestyle transformation. Time, freedom to travel, pursuing passion. Real estate, right? How they- Language and self-perception. How they view themselves. Then there's financial freedom. Escape the rat race. Be your own boss. Take back control. Build your own empire. Break free from the system. Smart money moves. Leverage. Cash flow. Passive income. Community of like-minded people. Proven system. Step-by-step blueprint. No BS. Hard truth. Authentic. Transparent. Language to avoid. Get rich quick. Guru. Secret formula. Guaranteed success. Easy money. No work required. Overnight success. Overly hype-driven language that sounds like typical internet marketing, corporate jargon, or traditional investment terminology. Primary promises, right? Uhm. And again, there's you might want to tweak these based on what you know and other research, but overall pretty good, right? Primary objections to how to address them. Skepticism about gurus and courses. Uh, financial risk and hidden costs. Landlord permission. Uhm, satur- market saturation competition. Time and complexity. Past failures. What about, you know, other solutions that people have tried? Expensive coaching programs from professional personalities like these folks. Uh, why they aren't good. DIY courses. Why they're not good. Traditional real estate investment. Other side hustle and business models. General entrepreneurship stuff. FIRE things. Uhm. So, this now is a pretty good document. So now I have it, okay? And so really that's it. I just wanted to show you another example of troubleshooting where, uh, if Quad is giving you a hard time for some reason, what you can do is you can use Poe. I mean, I can also test, let's see here, One minute. Well, I mean, I can remove the ChatGPT one from here and I wonder what I'd get. But it should be pretty similar to what I got from Poe. Because Poe is just basically pulling from the API feed of QuadSign for, right? So we're going to take this, copy and paste it, and we'll save it as a document. So I'll have this in a Google Drive folder for you, you'll have that, and then, uhm, you know, you'll see how this is important as we go into further models in the future, or modules in the future as well. Alright, thank you so much. Bye.
