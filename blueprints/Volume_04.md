Alright, so in this video we're going to be doing, like, short VSLs. This is, like, an interesting thing to teach because there are a lot of different structures. I kind of gave Quad, a project I have for Quad that has a kind of classic sales letter outline, um, a whole bunch of short VSLs combined in a document. And we're going to get into, like, using Quad and writing all the copy and all that stuff pretty soon. But, basically, it was like, hey, you know, find some commonalities and structures, and it did. But I think the best way to teach this is really, first of all, to go through examples. And then we can sort of look at, you know, how they match up with these different structures. And then really figure out, you know, some commonalities from there. So, we're going to start with one from CynoCell, okay. What I did is I basically pulled a bunch of short ones. These are all coming from Meta. I put them into SwipeBuilder, which is a tool I like to use, as you probably know at this point. and we'll go through Okay, so this first one is from CynoCell. I will just actually play it, and you can watch it. Alright, so we see that, and I of course have the script up as well. Sorry, 150. Maybe this bigger. Okay, so I know you just watched it. I'm going to read over it to you, okay? Shooting pain in your back or sciatica. Do this to relieve joint pain fast. Okay, I think about, um, our classic VSL structure, which I'm also going to pull up, give me a second here. Let's talk about our classic VSL structure, okay? So it's like this sort of big hook, quickly related to the pain point process of faces, quickly related to problems of a solution. So you don't need these in any of these. I'll keep it in this one, it's fine. Right, shooting back pain to your sciatica, do this to relieve joint pain fast. So, hook is sort of just like a quick callout, deal with the pain point, do this. What's this? A little bit of curiosity to relieve pain point fast. From there, it goes back into like a emotional story right away. You know, someone like me, me or like me was, uh, in pain. So, it's actually one of the most common things you'll find with short, like, mini VSLs. Right? I mean, you can call them mini VSLs or video ads, this is tough, it sort of blurs the line. I'm gonna use mini VSLs and sometimes video ads kind of interchangeably. Uhm, but there's sort of direct response with like a structure. And that's kind of what I, when I talk about a mini VSL, what I'm referring to. Right? So, yeah. And as with some of these other videos, I'm doing this one on a weekend, so if I pause and come back and repeat myself, I'm sorry to break the flow. It's frustrating for me too sometimes, but it's what it is, I've got kids, you know. Uhm, but yeah. Like, really, like, there's not really a lead in the short VSLs. Right? There's one of the biggest things is, like, pretty much, like, no lead. Right? So there's sort of, like, there's always going to be a hook. We're going to have a whole training on hooks and things like that. A couple of different things on hooks. Uhm, but usually it's, like, hook, and then the next part. Sometimes it's going to be basically go hook, background story, or, you know, and really the, It's more like a, you know, like a punch to the gut emotional story or mute, like, someone that feels close in pain, right? Something like in this range. So hook, background story, mechanism. And then when you get to this part of a product build and reveal, a lot of times it's going to be not actually that, depending on the VSL. It'll be, like, teasing a solution. Uhm, or, or, like, telling them about the solution that was created and telling them to click to get more information, right? I mean, it really just depends, and what it depends on is are you trying to send them to, like, a VSL? Or are we trying to send them to a, you know, product page on, like, something like Shopify, right? So this is going to try and send people to a VSL, most likely, right? So do this with really fast. So basically, right to an emotional story, right? My dad collapsed on the golf course when his knees locked up completely. He couldn't walk. He went to the doctor who said to try over-the-counter painkillers, prescription NSAIDs, cortisone shots, then he can talk about gel shots. When all of these failed, and he was in danger of losing his mobility completely, they were ready to perform invasive knee surgery with months of painful recovery. Okay, so that's sort of, like, your quick background story. of, like, being in pain. So it turns out, he had a surge of inflammation that was eating away all the cartilage in his joints until it was bone-on-bone agony. And according to Dr. Carlos Stevenson, our kind of introducing expert here, it's not, um, that, this is not uncommon. You could have years of inflammatory damage eating away at your joints right now. If you're experiencing stiffness, soreness, or can't move without pain, well, guess what? It's not because you're getting older or lacking exercise or anything like that. See, when we get into injured, so now we're kind of going right into the mechanism. So, you know, it was like the, and they're going to have some structures I'll show you. I mean, I can kind of show it to you here. Um, kind of the emotional story one. It's like, okay, hook, personal story, authority-backed mechanism reveal, right? Um, and this would be a solution. So it's like a morning ritual, and then promise benefits, hey, you'll get these benefits if you go find out what this morning ritual, right? And so it's kind of what we're seeing here. I know I've skipped around, but I mean, if we kind of, like, it's hard because I kind of wanted you to keep in mind this original classic structure, but there's also this one. So it's like basically here it goes into the mechanism, right? Um. Is this thing solutions don't work? I forgot it's why conventional treatments don't fail in this version of it. Okay, so it's like, what's the solution, right? It's almost like product buildup and reveal. Well, it's like Dr. Stevenson developed this pain, what pain experts call a seven-second morning ritual. It's safe, fast, and incredibly, it's supposed to say fast, like I did say fast in the video, I noticed that. Effective way to stop pain. Stop inflammation at the cellular level and rebuild cartilage to cushion and lubricate joints without addictive drugs, dangerous side effects, or risky surgeries. He just recorded a very brief presentation explaining exactly how the seven-second morning ritual can give you lasting joint pain relief. Get some more credibility about him here. Since you're over 50, you're experiencing soreness, numbness, or extreme pain, you need to hear this. So, if you're feeling stiff or in pain, tap the button and get his seven-second healing method. Now, tap the button and get his seven-second healing method. Story-driven ones, okay? We'll get this, uh, Feng Shui bracelet thing next, which I think I've got down here somewhere. And again, this is gonna be kind of, like, affiliate-y, like, little, Black hat, dirty, whatever you want to call it, right? Uhm, but, let's just look at the structure of this ad. Make it big. The hell? Okay, so, I mean, obviously, it's like, you want to take a shower after watching a video like this. Totally, right? Let's just look at it from a structural perspective, because this one does show the prop, right? So it's a good example, and by the way, you wouldn't have to be this aggressive and, like, you know, sell a bullshit product to do, like, a short structured video like this that then sells a product, you know? Okay. Billionaires have a secret. They don't, and they've done a damn good job keeping it for the rest of us, right? But today, you're going to hear what they never want, wanted you to find out. So there's, like, your hook. All right, then it goes right to kind of the product, but it's blind. This thing I'm wearing right now, it looks just like a, like, just a bracelet, but what it actually is, is a key. For years, I was broke, drowning in debt. I tried everything. Hustles, courses, manifesting, nothing worked. Until one night, everything changed. I was walking home, completely burned out. When this guy stopped me, he didn't say hello, didn't ask for anything. He just handed me this black bracelet and said six words, wear this and watch luck change. I laughed. I thought it was a prank, but something in his voice hit different. I put it on. The next morning, boom, $10,000 just showed up enough to pay my overdue bills and finally sleep. And that was Warm up, right? I got more money. So what is it? It's called a Feng Shui Black Obsidian Wealth Bracelet, and it's not just some spiritual accessory. This thing is worn by billionaire CEOs, A-list actors, athletes, people who don't leave success to chance. Because it works. And it kind of gives you a little, their little mechanism of why it's working, right? A little more social proof. Right now, they're giving away a free bracelet of every order, but they're almost out. Once this run is gone, it could be, you a year before more come back. So if it's still playing, this might be your shot. Put it on, watch what happens. If you're anything like me, you'll never want to take it off again. Okay, so. I've got my little different structures here. It kind of like, when I use Claude for this, right? There's like a mystery hook. Personal transformation story, product method reveal, what it is and how it works, kind of your mechanism, right, and an urgency. That's really, that's really it in a nutshell. So you kind of map this one to this structure number four. Uhm, you know, if we zoom back out to that broad, big overview, it's like, okay, hook, yeah. Uhm. Not really about the pain point or solution, it's more just like a pure hook. But it's like a background story. I guess, actually, if you count this as like the hook, then yeah, it kind of. Okay, I was broke. I was in pain. Somebody approached me, tried it. Thank you. It's changed right away. Can I prop reveal here? Mechanism gets explained here. So again, it's not as like cut and paste as like a classic VSL. Um, but this is sort of the structure you would see, right? And then. I wouldn't o********** and worry so much about these structures. It's good to look at them. But again, when we use. Cloud projects and AI and stuff, we'll be able to just pump these things out. Okay. Um, so. You're like, damn, I want to take a shower. Totally. So let's look at something that's a little bit, let's actually look at one more. Kind of storage driven thing and then we'll look at, um. Some things that are. Less dirty feeling. Okay. Um, gosh, I'm going to do that. Show us this one. This is the epic real estate. Okay. So this is gonna be for real estate. So it's gonna be like biz op and not like, you know, um, a physical product. So it was a little bit longer. Why does it keep doing that? So weird. What the hell? So weird. Okay, I like the little, uh, what-you're-still-here thing. That's actually a fun little move, right? Okay, so let's look at this guy. Oh, didn't see that. Okay, so what are we really seeing here? I've got the structure up. I believe it's on, It's one of the story ones here, right? So I'm thinking about which one I would say most matches. Like, that one matches the Feng Shui one really well, right? Okay, we go for this, right? Okay, so, Hook, the guy behind me, is no ordinary soldier. Okay, well, why not? That's your hook. That's your curiosity and your dopamine, right? Okay. This guy, he's a former, Army Ranger, he closed 14 deals and added 7 cash-flowing rental properties to his portfolio. Pretty impressive considering his life-long career had very little to do with real estate. So it's sort of like an immediate, like, introduce, like, a success story and talk about how they, like, how to succeed, right? But then it's, like, the background story, right? Before I worked with Daniel, he was a frustrated veteran, he was going through all this tough stuff. You know, he needed to change his life, right? Well, three months after discovering our rarely seen investing strategy, his entire business transformed. Not only has he built a thriving real estate portfolio, but he's also generating over $3,000 in monthly passive income from his rental properties. How is it possible? Two words, paper-flipping. So here we get into, like the transformation story. So again, it's kind of like, um, it's not really a mystery hook in this case, it's more like a, I'm trying to think how we'd say it, like, before-after story, sort of, you know, like, I don't know if I feel like I need another mechanism. Like, another outline for this one specifically. Give me a second. Alright. So, I guess you would argue, actually, that's Claude. I'm just curious what it said. I think I make, I think I agree with it. That it likes this contrarian hook authority opportunity, okay? That's what they say. So let's, let's see, what do they say it is here, right? Uhm, challenging conventional wisdom. Essentially, their argument would be, Hey, this guy behind me is no ordinary soldier, meaning you'd think a guy from the military wouldn't be able to build, like, a whole kind of real estate empire, right? Okay, fair enough. Personal story or authority? You know, yeah, like it's a personal story of how when he met Daniel, Daniel was going through all his trouble, and he helped Daniel, right? Okay. Okay, fair. How is it available? They have it here, like, paper flipping, right? Okay, I started teasing the mechanism. I think that, like, what this outline from Cloud is missing, uhm, would be, like, a brief explanation. How it works, right? Because it's not just paper flipping. It's, like, yeah, like, cool. But what is paper flipping? Well, instead of buying properties the traditional way, you know, Daniel, people learn how to use real estate deals and sell contracts for money, and it's not your typical fix and flip, right? This is unique. Results aren't typical. but we'll see you What if they were? What would happen, right? Creating this kind of income or future pacing it, but I can't go through it all in this short video. But if you're ready to take control of your future like Daniel did, I invite you to a special free online workshop that I'm hosting. It's how you're going to discover how to find deeply discounted off-market properties. Uhm, click the link below so I can show you exactly how this happened before this opportunity disappears. And then it sort of has a little, like, you know, last-minute thing Urgency, right? Uhm, but yeah, it really isn't often for BizOps. This part's actually like a free training case study. Hey, go here and we'll see, uhm, you know, show you how it works. Right? Real estate, mobile, okay, so sort of like hook, social proof. Transformation story, mechanism. There's really a mechanism and a solution. I've said this before, this is really the difference with BizOp, is like, there's less of a UMS. They talk about other things that don't work, but really it's not like, uhm, they tend to focus more on the UMS than the UMP, right. Uhm, results not typical, but what if they were? I can't cover all of this, I've got a free online workshop, free presentation, whatever it is. What you'll see, like, when you join the presentation workshop. Click now before it disappears. Get a free spot while you can, right. So the compiler's going to do the structure on my own. I'm going to write this out, like, do it like this here. So it's like, I just don't know how to do this a bit right. So it's sort of like, hook Guided by expert spokesperson Top bottom to Killing it Introduce UMP, actually UMS, really. Explain UMS Results not typical But what if they were? Future Pace Can't teach the UMS fully here, but I created a full IRA 3 Workshop video, whatever whatever, right? You know, CTA with urgency, remind them of the opportunity. Okay, that's really my version for something like this. Simpler than what Claude did, but to me this is just sort of like what, like, we're looking at here. In fact, I'm not even gonna say I'm gonna go tell Claude, my little Claude conversation here. Hmm, and of course Claude's like, oh, you're right. Well, thanks, Claude thinks I'm better than it, which is true. Probably, right? There might be other options that are better, right? So, let me, let there are other times where that structure works better. Let's see. There is, Let's look at this one real quick. This one's gonna be a story base, I think, but let's go. Let's go look at here. This is Kevin David. . . . So if we look at that one, for a boy, Kevin. And then we need to go through it again. But let's go back to number two, okay? So challenging conventional wisdom, right? Real estate, stock market, earning a Care will return, personal story off the wall. You know, credibility builder. So let's see. Yeah. It was a better way. Our businesses have been doing this. I guess you guys argue they're kind of selling like a transformation again, like instead of a single case study, but it's like we help with this transformation, right? So we're doing this thing called Amazon automation. Why can we do it? Because we're selling random products like, let me skateboard. It's kind of almost like your little mechanism, your UMS, right? How it actually works. I mean, you know, I don't know. As I look at this one, I'm not as in love with this number 2 that Claude gave me, so I might remove it. Let's ask Claude, though. You know, you can come along for the journey with me. Let's see here. Given that structure I just shared, how would you do, How I improved this ad. Okay, so this is the same one we just watched. Uhm, hook, opportunity introduction, it's kind of the same. Quick credibility, explaining UMS, business model reveal, like how it works, right, rejection handling, qualification requirements, can't explain everything here, but, CTA for urgency, risk reversal, what sorts could happen, final CTA. I think that's better, so I'm going to kind of take, like, that, and replace number two with this sort of thing we see. Contrarian structure. Okay, so, like, traditional investments suck. There's a different opportunity. Okay, now, this is, like, for that video. So, actually, let's do this. If we were going to take this out. Outline, make it broader, so it would apply to, uhm, use as a template guide, selling other business, top things, how would you present it. Let's see what Quad does with that, too. This is much better. Okay, let's do it. This is what we need. This is what we need in our lives. Okay, cool. Much better. Right, traditional method is earning terrible money. You know what we're gonna do? Please hold. Actually, I need to pause. What I'm gonna do. I like that. Like, this is great. Please do the same thing for this script. I mean, it looks like maybe a little bit, like, over the top. Maybe that was a little too weird. Because I was thinking about if I could do these for, like, every single one. But, maybe not. Okay. But for this one, I like it, right? Traditional investment income method is earning terrible returns, right? You need to be smart. So, it could just be like, you know, this is not the right method. You don't have, it doesn't have to be exactly like this. People only do current method for one reason, they don't know any better. Here, uh, there's a thing called whatever it is. Are, you know, students departing or earning, you know, whatever more than traditional method. Or just earning less money, whatever it is. You don't have to say that they're earning better than traditional method, but like, by all sense, quick credibility, anchor. What is it, right? Here's an example. Here's why returns are higher. Here's an analogy. Here's industry validation. Meh. That case is like, they were like, oh, you know, e-commerce is the number one trading category. What makes sense? Airbnb, you know, the number one search thing, whatever it is, right? Business model reveal. Production handling, right? I think that makes sense. That's cool. All This module is tricky to teach because, again, once, when they're short, there's actually more, way more variants with, like, short VSLs than ads than there are with long ones, which might be kind of makes sense. I don't know, right? Because it's, like, with short ones, you're sort of, like, you, like, there's, you're not gonna fit everything in, so you're sort of just, it's like a hook, and you're just trying a lot of different stuff, right? Uhm, let's look at a couple more here. I think these two, at least, maybe this one, this is the one I'm also, all kind of follow a similar structure, which is to be close to number one here. So let's look at this one. Vital, uh, BP. I think it's up here, higher. Alright, I'm going to pause here and we can look at this script together too, okay? So, this is our viral BP1. Hook, this 7 second RA flush can normalize your blood pressure. Turns out this proven protocol restores blood flow to the heart, brain, and other vital organs. Without doing anything drastic like diet changes, drugs, or heart surgeries. Just listen to this. So, it's sort of like, your hook, a little lead, like, kind of like a, a promise, right? It's going to do this without, like, you're going to fix everything without any annoying solutions. Eating too little salt can be just as dangerous as eating too much. Alarming, right? So, what is this? kind of continue off the hook and it's doing a loop. A little bit educational, like we talked about with medium length VSLs, too. Most people think salt, eating less salt, means healthier blood pressure, but a top Miami heart doctor says that's like turning down the water pressure to fix a clogged pipe. He explains it like this. So, now we sort of get right into a mechanism, right? Most of the arteries have a smooth Teflon coating that allows blood to flow with very little friction, but over time this protective coating gets damaged and scratched. You're about to try this at home by smoothing out the scratches with a plastic brush. But once plaque starts building up, it doesn't stop. And here's the scary part. Not only does plaque build up spike your blood pressure, but calcium also begins to get trapped in the plaque. Yes, it's the same calcium that makes your bones hard. It starts in your toes and creeps through your body, making your arteries stiff and rigid like a crusty clogged pipe. And many folks start feeling stuff like chest pressure, shortness of breath, painful tingling in their arms, but by then the damage is already done. Playing back on salt won't fix this problem. Eating less salt to make your arteries smooth again is like trying to fix a clogged pipe by turning down the water pressure. To fix the problem, you need to clean it out. Okay, so, if you think about it, we have the hook, a little bit of education, and then we basically have the unique mechanism. If you watch like the neural example we did in the medium length VSLs, if you watch that, it's also how it sort of becomes a bigger problem. There's an amplification of the problem. So it's like, not just that it, stays in your toes, it can like, you know, kind of move to your chest, shortness of breath, tingling in the arms, all that, the damage is already done. Right, so, little metaphor. What's the solution? Well, Miami Heart Doctor developed a simple yet powerful 7 second RE flush that helps clear out even the most stubborn plaque. When your REs are clear and flexible, your blood pressure naturally returns to normal. So, there's a 7 second RE flush is the solution, your REs return to normal, you have to go get your favorite foods, it's easy and it's safe, just click below to see the RE flush while it's still online, so a bit of like, urgency, call to action, testimonial here, one of his patients, Linda, tried everything, then she tried this, within weeks her doctor was amazed by her numbers, and it's not just Linda, thousands of people have had success here, so, you know, if you want to address your own root cause, go see Dr. Lewis' 7 second RE flush that's helping thousands of Americans be healthy. Okay, so, what would they have? If I look at my CLAWD ones, yeah, I think this one I had CLAWD break it down previously, and it didn't, it's gonna make this a lot easier. A lot of like, blanks, so it's like this 7 time frame, 7 second hard refresh can do whatever, right? Contrary to the statement, it turns out, eating salt can be just as dangerous as not eating salt, whatever, right? Uhm, really, it's like, okay, hook and contrarian choice, authority setup and belief challenge. I would call this, like, education. I would probably say plus, like, education pays off, contrarian hook, right? Mechanism of reveal with progressive explanation, I think is valid. How it's supposed to work, what goes wrong, vice versa. Escalation patterns is what I call amplification. Systems cascade, and that's why common solutions won't fix it. There's the logic, right? To fix the problem, you need to, it's basically the UMS right here, right? That's why an expert does it, the system fixes these things, you don't have to give up things you love, it's convenient, social proof, like mentioned. Call to action. So I think this is actually a pretty good, uhm, that one's, this one's actually pretty solid, it kind of matches this, right? Let's look at one from Ryze. I am going to, how about I'll just play it as well, give me a minute here. Ryze is funny because they are, Like, a little branded, but they actually are a pretty sneaky, aggressive, uh, direct response. Let me make sure I have which Ryze one this is. If your toe is driving you nuts, right, that's that one, okay. Uhm, is it this one here? This is, yeah, yeah, this one's the one. The reason why, we'll pull it up. This one which is really just like, you know, you could argue this is contrarian too, but basically it's like, hey, you have this problem, here's what you need to know, and it's going right into the mechanism. Here's the real cause. Most people don't realize it's the first not random, it starts with whatever it is, right? Uhm, so it's basically the UM, this one does have a UMP, but there's a better, different approach, you know, teasing whatever it is, brief benefit stack, and then a soft CTA, like in the case of RISE, how can we fix it, there's certain compounds that have been used for centuries to help regulate Thank you. uric acid levels, help your, keep your joints healthy, some of the most powerful ones come from adaptogenic mushrooms, mentions reishi, portocep, shiitake, instead of taking a bunch of stuff, you can get all three in reishi mushroom coffee, it's packed with these adaptogenic mushrooms, supports your body, it's organic, sugar-free, completely natural, if you don't feel the difference, you can simply send the uh, back, the empty bag for a full refund, right? So, in this case, there's no, uh, they're not revealing the product specifically in the video, but they're basically talking about the product and the guarantee, and you can get it, right? So it's sort of, this matches it pretty well. So really the idea here is like hook, mechanism, tf. Teasing solution, I would say it's kind of more than a tease, though, to be honest with you. in some cases, right? Mentioning each compound or component, why it's an important part of an overall solution, plus potentially brief, uh, other proof elements. Okay, this one is really soft on the CTA. But because I'm trying to make this a little bit more universal, CTA may include Quick Risk Reversal or Guarantee. Uhm, right? There's that one. I mean, you can look at more of these. This is the one from EMA. EMA, like, you know, is, uh, like, does, like, Probiotics and stuff like that. Uhm, I'm not going to show the video. I'll just read it real quick. Watch what Magnesium does to your bowels. If you have to wait more than four times after your poop, here's why. The Mayo Clinic confirms that stuck poop can cause, Did I not make this whole thing 18? Sorry. Stuck poop can cause these embarrassing skate marks on your undies. It's gross, right? But, Stuck poop causes a traffic jam. How do you clear it out? Uh, fire helps? Nope. What about drinking water? Nope. Do this to clear out stuck poop fast. Kind of surprising. So it's sort of just educational, a little of a mechanism. It's not this. It's not this. There's an easier way. It's a seven-second, uh, poop method created by Dr. Gina Sam. She's going to show you a seven-second morning ritual for a satisfying full colon release that anyone can do at home. You're feeling backed up, bloated, constipated. So tap the button to see the seven-second ritual. It's going to get things moving along, clearing out your bowels, and you could even feel 10 to 15 pounds lighter. What's interesting of this sort of one is like, um, I'm going to move this think about is like, it's sort of the same idea. It's like hook mechanism. So sometimes I teach component, right? Other times teasing a method solution without more detail. You know, poop. But really kind of matches the same structure here. Okay, with the legendary men's care. Okay, let me go to a couple more. They're a little bit more on their noses. I imagine people who do this. The more on-the-nose stuff have probably already left. Like, like, F this guy. Let's look at the sweet, the odorless cat would be a good one. Ortho shoes. Let's look at these. I'm gonna play these two back-to-back, probably. Here's the odorless cat. Can I get this one to actually go fullscreen? Nope. Cool. Great. Like, that good ol' cat pee one. Cat parents, pause the scroll for a moment because we're about to tell you you can change your life. This is how I eliminated my cat pee's odor without doing any of these, okay? So, sort of like, hook, calling out who it's for, cat parents. How I eliminated my pain point without, you know, fast. If you go back to, like, even that original overview of, like, you know. Post a solution that saves time and money, right? Existing solutions didn't work, right? I tried these things, they didn't work. Then I found a solution. I came across a video on Facebook that was describing this tiny waste that could effortlessly eliminate cat pee odor in my home without using any chemicals. It's called Product, okay? And it works by, and here's sort of your unique mechanism of the solution. Some sort of features and benefits. It has an affiliate link. No motor, no switches, no sound, goes to work as soon as it's plugged in. Like, a little bit more of, like, future pacing, what your life looks like after, right? I can enjoy clean air, I have better sinuses, I don't have headaches, my home is cleaner, my sleep is improved, right? And then the quick call to action. Right now they're running a special offer for a limited time. Click the link below. And get your, get yours before it expires. So if you know these short VSL structures that Quad pulled out, Let's ask Quad about that, too. Then we can kind of improve upon I should probably say, in your opinion. I've seen this before AfterStruxure. Do we still have that before AfterStruxure? I think I replaced it. Did I? So we have this here. CatStore, you know, parents watch this, whatever it is. PainFrustration, tried other things and it didn't work. So in this case, that MethodTeased is sort of, like, revealed, right? Came across this product. But you have a unique mechanism here, right? how it works. See, it's like a saying that matches this, but I'm actually calling it a tag of a child with these. The goal of selling different types of products. Some cases, revealing the product, explaining how it works, features, and benefits. In other cases, selling. A solution or ritual, not revealing the product. What would that look like? Let's see what Claude does. Let's check it out, you know. I tried a popular solution, but there was no consequences. Pain points, waste of money, time, health. Come across a discovery source. What I found was starting a solution type that could benefit, that could benefit from the negatives. It's called a product, it works by doing this. They have key features. Ease of use, or it's a method. How, solves it, what you avoid, authority mentioned, personal transformation, specific improvements, CTA for products. Yeah, this is good. I like this a lot more than we had before. So let's take this. Let's replace what they had here. Put this one here. I'll format this so it's less overwhelming. But, thought that was worth looking at too. Alright, let's see, any other ones I want to do? Oh yeah, what if there's the ortho shoes one? I mean, this is pretty, like, white hat and queen. But it's good to look at that example too. I feel like I wish I'd done some of these earlier instead of going through the most aggressive shit right out the gate. So, ortho shoe one. So let's see, let's ask Collab on that one real quick too. I have that, it's all these other ones included. I thought you did. I did 14 and some 18 and some, but that's fine, it doesn't really matter, uhm, font size that is. Can you do the same thing with this video now? Let's see what it does for this one. Okay, well, I'll never use common solution for actual situation again, professional credibility. I'm a profession that relates to problems. You know, like I'm a doctor, I'm a poker player, I'm a hiker. I mean, honestly, I would not zoom into this part. I had an important event, something I've been looking forward to. I was planning to do whatever I do. I mean, this structure is a little weird. Basically, one day I took, like, my old thing and then I switched it for, like, this new solution, my life changed. Work was better. My body felt better. I was able to, like, have, like, you know, results when I'm living my normal life. I'm pain-free. I advise everyone to use this solution, including their everyday life. The company creates this. You know, comparison, security, technical benefits, social benefits. I think it's, like, pretty good. Um, I would modify it more, but maybe I'll modify this one and put it in here. I'm going to clean this up a little bit for you. Save a bunch of tablets. And then we're going to go ahead and be moving on to actually using creating, uh, you know, all types of VSLs in one of the most upcoming sections here. I think I'm going to do the specific hooks training and the one on, like, generating endless hooks and ADHD hook ads. I did that in CA Pro, but it's a really good training and it's super important. So I'm going to put that one into RMBC2 after these. And then we'll get into actually creating tons of VSLs, but I think I'm going to put that hook training first so you can see. Because that next part is also kind of like mini VSLs that are like three to six minutes long. And it's going to give you these sort of ADHD, like, hook ads. But you're also going to have, like, a bunch of scripts and templates of, like, things that you can put into. Enjoy that, and we will be, uh, reconnecting soon.
