Alright, let's get to, uh, the next example. Just real quick, I do want to show you, you know, for the end of that last one. This was the, uh, Opal Beauty VSL for whatever it was, uh, 30 minutes, I think I said, 28 minutes. I put into this document as well. I'm actually right through it. I won't, I promise I won't in this video, uh, but I did a word count. It's 5,000 267 words. Pretty crazy, okay. Let's go back to projects in the brief generator. Okay, so let's look at another example. Let's look at Airbnb Arbitrage. Let's say, I'll close this stuff for now. We already got this stuff here. Thank for being I kind of want to not lose whatever's in cloud, it's fine. Uhm, you know, we've been doing that Airbnb Arbitrage example. I want your help generating a new brief for our Airbnb Arbitrage coaching program. I've attached a UMP and also some market research that you can pull from. I've also included a document with some additional relevant information. Please go ahead and get started now. So I did for this one. We've got the unique mechanism, you may recall from this video as well. I went with the, uhm, the income to asset gap, I'm pretty sure, yeah. Income to solution, asset gap, you're trying to, you're trying to solve an asset gap problem with an income gap solution, okay? So in this case, what I'm trying to do, one of the things I'm trying to show you is like, well, what if I don't have, uhm, Like a website already, right? To go after. Okay, we've got the UMP, you've got the Unified Research Document, which you will recall us doing, right? Uhm, and then, I did create this, because you usually would have at least some information. So basically I used Gemini to create a little, like, I'm gonna call it something different than a brief, I'm gonna say Overview, I don't like the Asset Control System Coaching Program, but it's fine. Oh, okay, I see. Actually, I can still read this, frankly. The Asset Accelerator, okay? I had it basically called, like, a case study. Spokesperson, Guru, Marcus McHays, Reluctant Mentor, 34 year old guy is burned out, it's not a flash of guru. Core Promise, and it basically created, like, the core curriculum in a week program designed to be added to the vague low support course, and I had to create modules. Dietetic Coaching Components, you offer $8,000 for three payments. Guarantee, you'll secure your first property within four months if you don't work with you one-on-one, so dearest investment. Okay, so that's, like, it's in there. It's kind of cool. It's basically gave Gemini, let me see, like, I'll show you what I did in case you're curious, right? In case you ever want to do this as a fun little, uh, case study here. Why should I do this? That's weird. Uhm, so I did one for, like, financial, which you'll see in a minute. I'm like, hey, cool, let's do something for an Airbnb arbitrage program. Uh, sending sales. Had to do coaching, sketch the program details here, I can use it as an example. Also create a fictional spokesperson and relevant data. I gave it the, uhm, unified research thing in the UMP, and this is what created copy and pasted it. So that's how I did it, in case you were curious. Thanks, Gemini. Alright, so, what prompt did we do here? I want your help generating a new brief for our Airbnb arbitrage coaching program, UMP, market research, and document for additional relevant information. So, let's go ahead and upload that stuff to cloud. We can just sort of copy and paste it over to our RMBC2 brief generator, and we'll upload those documents. Give me one moment. Alright, they are uploading. Right away, dear cloud. So now you can just see it do it. Core archetypes, stack of graphics, pain points, trying to solve an asset gap problem from income gap solutions, getting trapped, patience of paycheck living, inability to handle emergencies, never escape the night shift, 9 to 5 grind, can't build generational wealth, working till death. If you promise this, we'll show you the hidden truth about why every side hustle you've tried has failed, and reveal the asset control method that lets you start accumulating cash flow in real estate assets without needing hundreds of thousands of dollars or perfect credit. You'll discover why you've been solving the wrong problem this entire time, the specific method that bridges the gap from income dependent to asset rich, how to control cash flow and properties without owning them, I'll show you proof why this works for regular people starting with limited capital, what does it look like, okay, waking up to money deposited from guests who've stayed while you slept, multiple income streams, providing 5,000 to 15,000 a month passes of income, complete financial peace of mind, building a portfolio of cash flowing assets worth hundreds of thousands, lifestyle transformation, complete autonomy over time and schedule, never asking permission for time off, They'll either quit their corporate job forever, or they'll work from anywhere with just a laptop and internet connection, time, freedom to travel, respect and recognition, being part of an exclusive community, legacy creation, ensuring their children's financial security, confidence from mastering a skill that creates lasting wealth, existing things that exist, high-ticket stuff, DIY, traditional real estate, other side hustles, etc. You need mechanism of the problem, this is sort of our UMP UMS from the document, the asset control method, unique nickname, that's why we have this one here, the rental arbitrage loophole, the asset gap bridge, control for ownership system, main ingredients, MA, bold claims, acquire and automate your first cashflow and rental asset in 90 days, replace your 9 to 5 income within 18 months using the asset control method, properties with $5,000 to $15,000 per unit instead of $100,000, generate passive income that works while you sleep, travel or spend time with family, supporting claims, start building real wealth with minimal upfront capital, create win-win partnerships with landlords who actually want this arrangement, automate 90% of operations so this doesn't consume your life, build a defensible business and markets others overlook, program what What it is, is this, module breakdown. High-value support components. Now, frankly, honestly, if I want to write the VSL, I probably would upload because it was sort of brief, right? It's fine, but I might, if I had a good thing that really sketches out what the product includes, I might actually do, uh, include that as well. I'll be honest with you, so keep that in mind when we get to the VSLs. Background story. It's got Marcus's journey, Marcus Mac, right? Um, main speaker is Marcus, second speaker, NA, brand company, testimonials, proof elements, before, after screenshots, credibility builders, 90% millionaires, but wealth reveals. Real estate, Federal Reserve data confirms the asset gap is widening, housing shortage creates unprecedented opportunity for rental arbitrage operators, it's credibility, I think these are really sort of things from the brief as well, results, credibility, normal price, $8,000. Now again, I might also, I would do this probably as a book a call VSL, not a, uhm, book a Now as a VSL to sell a product for this much, for that much money, doing bonuses which are cool, scarcity, future pacing, here's what's going to happen for 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, objections. This is another guru trying to get rich selling courses, the real cost would be way higher. Landlords will agree to this, everyone is doing this, won't work anymore, becoming their overwhelming side hustle. I tried other business opportunities and failed, got a lot of objections, right, I don't have money to start, what if the market crashes, and then there's hoax, right. The hidden truth about why every side hustle you've tried has failed, rental arbitrage loophole that landlords actually want, high control 2.3 million real estate assets without owning a single property, the asset control method that's creating millionaires without traditional loans. Investors wait for down payments, but the housing crisis is actually creating the biggest opportunity of our lifetime. So I went kind of fast, but the reason why is I just want you to see how, it's really about journey of the brief, you can read through these examples, and you should. Uhm, but really all we did, research, mechanism, and the other part of it too, the, uhm, little starting thing. Okay, so, same thing as with the UDI storm example, we can now take this and write all kinds of columns. I'll be short as, long as, all that, and I'll do that in another module, I'll keep these shorter. I'm going to do two more videos with two more examples.

Alright, so in the last video we went through the difference between the kind of classic RMBC brief and the new brief. What we're going to do now is show you how to put that into action. And we're going to do it with the Clawed Project. So I'm going to show you how to set up the Clawed Project, and I'm going to show you how it works, okay? The Clawed Project, I've got this in the old Clawed Project, I'll have it too. Your instructions, which are here, and also here, are pretty simple. This is, the instructions are, again, in case you're just watching this video in a vacuum, telling Clawed what the purpose of this project is. So your job is to create new briefs for copywriting projects. These are things that I can give to Clawed Or other LLMs to have them write copy. We'll mostly be focused on BSLs here, but I may end up asking you to create a brief for an e-commerce page in the future as well. I've included two documents in your knowledge base for now. The first is an in-depth brief. It is titled the new brief. The second is an outline of the classic video sales letter structure I've used for a long time. That one is mostly for reference. Here's how this will work. I will use your chat feature to provide documents, that can assist you in writing the brief for a specific product. You'll then do that for anything where you don't have the information, you can use placeholders to start. And I uploaded the new brief right here. I'm not going to open it. It's the same thing here. So nothing filled in, just the new brief and my classic sales letter outline, which you saw, right? So, Why is this so helpful? Well, let me show you an example prompt here. Okay. I can go in, and again, you'll get this as well. Watch our brief from here. I want your help generating a new, generating a new brief for our brand Opal Beauty's Unity Ice Room. Here is the current product page where you can pull some inputs, and I linked it to the current product page because Quad can do it and go to the internet. Additionally, I'm attaching a UMP and also some market research that you can pull from when writing the brief. I'm also including a document with the ingredients and relevant studies. Please go ahead and get started now. Right? Same thing that's here. So, what did I upload? The unified research document we did for eye serum. I uploaded the ingredient research we did from that research module about pulling ingredients. I uploaded the UMP and UMS. So, for that, if you remember from the UMP section, I picked, let me find the, uh, example to show you. Oh, great. I don't have it in here. Perfect. Wonderful. Give me a moment. I will show you. As you recall, we looked at a couple of different options. So, I basically picked the one about the architecture, the college and architecture breakdown. Now, is this the world's best UMP or UMS? I don't know still. But, for example purposes, I thought it was good enough. So, this was generated verbatim. I didn't change anything. This is what we did in that unique mechanism section when I was showing you examples, right? Okay, so I have that as well. Make sure these all get into that, uh, document. So, I'm going to do that actually now. While I'm here, I know you're not, you can't see what I'm doing. All right. So, so I'm going to get started now. So here's what's really cool. I'll help you create a comprehensive brief for Opal Beauty's beauty eye serum. Let me first gather information from the product page and then create the brief using the research documents you provided. So here are the filters. I just have web search enabled, right? This is neat. Now you might be asking, well, what if I don't, what if it doesn't have a website and I want to create a brief for a copy? We will have examples. For that as well. I'm not going to show you four examples. I'm going to show you one with eye serum, uh, one for a, the Airbnb arbitrage we've been doing, one for a, if you just have the ingredients and the ingredient research for a supplement and nothing else, and then one for like a financial. Okay? Now I'll create a comprehensive brief for the beauty eye serum BSL using all the information from the research documents and product page. And it did. So check this out. I mean, I could do it in real time for you to see, but we're actually, I'm gonna do some real time so you can see the magic, but check this out. UTI serum BSL brief. Who's the audience primary target problem aware and solution where a woman aged 35 to 60 peak target 40, 55. Well, how did we get that from our unified research document, right? Demographics. It's got this cool stuff in here as well, which came from the research target as well, right? Um, or sorry, the unified research document. Psychographics shocked by sudden appearance of aging signs. I wake up one day and notice something new, a line where there wasn't before, feeling betrayed, experiencing identity crisis, all this sort of stuff. What are her pain points? Sudden shocking appearance of eye aging signs. Crows feet, under eye wrinkles, puffiness that seem to appear overnight, dark circles making them look perpetually tired, crepey loose skin that's lost its snap and firmness, loss of identity and confidence, no longer turning heads or feeling attractive, avoiding photos and mirrors, looking older than they feel inside, fear of becoming invisible or irrelevant in society, financial frustration from failed solutions, spending hundreds, thousands on eye creams that don't work, feeling scammed by friends, expensive department store products, fear of wasting more money on another disappointing product, secondary pain points, short term, daily makeup taking longer, concealer not working, looking tired all the time, long term, fear of starting aging, loss of professional relevance, relationship insecurities, big promises about how the sales copy will change their lives forever, teaser promises for the VSL self, I'm going to reveal the real, reveal of the hidden reason why your eye creams. I failed you and it's not what you think. You'll discover the breakthrough science that explains why your eyes age faster than the rest of your face. I'll show you the one missing piece that makes all the difference between products that work and products that waste your money. By the end of this presentation, you'll understand exactly what to look for in an eye treatment and why this change is everything. What does it look like when a prospect's pain points have been solved? Visual transformation. Eyes that look bright, rested and alert, matching how they feel inside. Smooth, firm skin that has regained its bounce and elasticity. Dramatically reduced crow's feet and under-eye wrinkles. Lighter, brighter under-eye area free from dark circles and puffiness. Confident enough to go makeup-free or with minimal concealer. Emotional empowerment. Feeling attractive and confident in their own skin again. Looking in the mirror and recognizing themselves. Receiving compliments about looking refreshed and youthful. Professional confidence restored, commanding respect and attention. Freedom from the anxiety of aging. Lifestyle change. Faster morning routine. No need for heavy concealer. Confidence in photos and social situations. Peace of mind knowing that they found a solution that actually works. Financial relief from ending the cycle of expensive disappointments. What solutions for the reader's problems exist already and why aren't they working? So as I pause here for a moment, I want you to see, Do you see how nice this is, though, already? When you, You go to write copy, or VSL, or when your LLM goes to write copy, or a VSL, you're gonna have everything that you need. Now, you might need to change it, you might need to tweak it, or modify it, or anything like that, but, uhm, overall, it's, you know, really good. So we, this came from the Unified Research document, right, Mass Eye Creams, Mass Market Eye Creams. Prestige Department Store Brands, Professional Treatments, What They Tried, Why It's Inadequate, right, all these really nice, Budget Active Serums, Ordinary CeraVe, High-End Miracle Creams, Hope in a Jar of Minimal Innovation, it's so good, it's so sick, I love this, right, okay, Unique Mechanism of the Problem and Unique Mechanism of the Solution, Unique Mechanism of the Problem, College and Architecture Breakdowns, this is our UMP, the real reason eye creams fail isn't just collagen loss, it's collagen architecture breakdown happening at the dermal-epidermal junction. Now, here is one note, our current Unity product page talks about the dermal-epidermal junction, so, it took our current mechanism and it did tie it into the DEJ. I'm actually pretty cool with that, because I liked the DEJ thing, um, as you will recall from having one watch the mechanism video, probably. That being said, if I didn't like it, I would just tell Claude, hey, this is good, you know what, I want to move away from the DEJ, rewrite the mechanism without it, right here, and Claude would just revise this, okay? But I actually like it, like it. Think of young skin like high-quality fabric with a perfectly tight, organized weave. Every collagen thread is in its proper place, working together to create Smooth, strong, beautiful skin, but as we age, something far more devastating occurs than simple thread loss. Those collagen threads don't just disappear, they become loose, tangled, and lose their organized structure. The hooks that connect your skin layers at the DEJ break down and disappear. So I guess right here, is it kind of like, trying to do too much? Maybe, I might give feedback or revise it, we'll see. Instead of the tight, precise weave, your skin's foundation becomes like fabric that's been stretched and twisted. Until the threads are jumbled together. The separation between skin layers means nutrients can't reach the skin's surface effectively, dark circles appear as blood vessels become more visible, skin begins to collapse inward forming wrinkles and crow's feet, fluid accumulates creating puffy under-eye bags, skin loses its firm, useful snap. Unique mechanism of solution, the structural renewal system. The breakthrough solution isn't to add more collagen to broken fabric, it's to restore the organized structure of the weave itself through our three-step structural renewal system. Step one, the structural renewal signal. Dipalmitoyl hydroxyproline acts like a master weaver, commanding your skin's machinery to pull loose tangled collagen threads taut and reorganize them back into their proper weave. Modified with palmitic acid, it penetrates deep to where structural damage exists. The targeted repair complex, precise amino acids, proline, glycine, and alanine provide exact building blocks for collagen synthesis, not random proteins, but the specific materials your skin needs to rebuild the organized structure. Step three, the integrity locking system. The same compounds that inhibit matrix melloproteinases, the enzymes that destroy collagen architecture, protecting your newly restored structure from future breakdowns. Unique nickname for the unique mechanism. They put the DEJ renewal protocol or the structural renewal system. Teaser phrase. The three-step skin unifying system that rebuilds your eye area from the inside out. That's a good phrase. I like that. The DEJ breakdown that reverses collagen architecture break, break through the, sorry, the DEJ breakthrough that reverses collagen architecture breakdown. The structural renewal discovery that's changing everything about eye aging. Pretty cool. Pretty good. These are nice. They're not in any of these things, but there are quads coming up with them here. Okay, studies. This is really just directly from the ingredient research that we found previously. Bold product claims. Primary results claim. Visibly reduced crow's feet and fine lines go up to 39% in just four weeks. Brighten dark circles and restore even skin tone around eyes. Firm sagging under eye bags for a more youthful appearance. Restore skin's natural snap and elasticity that you thought was gone forever. Achieve professional grade results without the professional price or procedures. Emotional transformation claims. Look as refreshed and vibrant as you feel inside. Regain confidence to go makeup free or with minimal concealer. Turn heads again and receive compliments about looking well rested. Feel in control of your aging process instead of victimized by it. Skip the concealer and enjoy free with faster, easier morning routines. Alright, some nice procs, claims about the product. What is the product? Unity Eye and Revive Serum by Opal Beauty. Core features, has a little stuff around, you know, how many fluid ounces. I think that's accurate, I would probably confirm, should have gotten it from the website. Lightweight, fast absorbing serum, texture that works beautifully under makeup, clean formulation free from parabens, phylates, synthetic fragrances, silicones, etc. Small batch crafted for quality assurances in USA facilities. Key benefits and fascinations. Penetrates deep into the dermal-epidermal junction where eye aging begins. Features six clinically proven ingredients working in synergy. The wound treatment targeting collagen architecture breakdown. Works in three distinct phases, signal, repair, and lock. Gentle enough for sensitive eye area. Powerful enough for visible results. Suitable for all skin types and ages, 35 plus. What makes it unique? Targets the root cause. Other eye treatments dismiss entirely. Combines peptide technology with plant-based actives. Addresses multiple eye concerns simultaneously. Wrinkles, dark circles, and puffiness. Clinically backed ingredients at therapeutic concentrations. Clean beauty standards without compromising efficacy. Background story. So I should have a placeholder. Need information about the brand, founder, spokesperson. This is okay. We'll be able to do something about this, okay? Watch. Uh, discovery story framework. The problem escalation. Personal experience with eye aging frustration. Trying countless expensive products that failed. Feeling betrayed by sun appearance, wrinkles, and dark circles. The traditional solutions failure. Spent thousands on department store creams, professional treatments, dermatologist visits, nothing worth long term. The research quest. Deep dive into skincare science. Discovery of DHA research. Realization that industry was targeting the wrong problem. Breakthrough moment. Understanding that college and architecture breakdown, not just college and loss, was real culprit. Discovering specific ingredients that could address it. The testing phase. Working with formulators to create the structural renewal system. Initial testing and refinement. The success in sharing personal transformation results. Friends and family asking for the formula. Decision to share with other women facing same struggles. Main speaker in the VSL. Placeholder in the details about the primary spokesperson. So again, this is sort of like, where, probably, I'm gonna say we might do it from like, the perspective a woman who is, like, I might actually write it from Laura's perspective. You know, Laura, you know, looks beautiful. My wife, Laura. But, nice that we have it. Uhm, second speaker, expert, Dr. Blaine Schilling. So that's him. Brand partnership, Opal Beauty brand values. Pulled these from our website. Testimonials, these are testimonials from our website. We are gonna have more. Social proof, it pulled from our website. Credibility builders for opening. Harvard researchers have identified the hidden cause of eye aging that cosmetic companies don't want you to know about. Breakthrough dermatologist. Dermatological research reveals why 97% of eye creams fail. Clinical studies on our key ingredients show up to 45% wrinkle reduction in 60 days. Dermatologists developed formula backed by peer-reviewed research. So again, you might need to tweak a few things here, but not too shabby. Medical endorsement. Doctor endorsed by a lean anti-aging physician with 30 years of experience. Recommended by medical professionals who've seen the clinical data. You know, I guess it's true. Uh, industry recognition. The clean beauty breakthrough that's changed everything about eye care. Future discussions about next generation skincare science. Normal retail price. Actual VSL price. This is because we have a subscribe and save, so we would want to, you know, get clear on this. Save up to 62% off retail. Save $45.50 on first order. Best value pricing. Not available in stores. Multiple options of pricing. Option one sampler has pricing here. Option two. Option three. Guarantee. It's all guarantee terms here. Bonuses. You know, we're probably not going to do any bonuses, but good to know. Scarcity elements. Supply based scarcity. Small batch crafted for quality assurance. High demand often leads to temporary out of stock situations. Limited production capacity. Supplies are limited. Offer based scarcity. Special pricing not available elsewhere. Presentation only pricing. No guarantee how long the offer will be available. Future paced results and benefits. Now these probably came from our website, I don't know. Week one, week two, because we're testing one version that has this and one that doesn't on Orlando right now, but I think it's actually still doing them on its own. Week one through two. Immediate increase in hydration. Skin plumping, eye area feels more supple. By the way, I'm wearing, my skin looks good, I mean, I'm wearing the eye serum, I'm using the eye serum right now, and also talon and other products. Really great products, by the way. Uhm, so basically it tells you what to expect in week one and two, one and two, three and four, five and eight, all three months, three and six, right? Common objections and answers. I've tried everything, nothing works, that's why we developed Unity differently. Every other product you've tried targets the same collagen loss, but the real problem is collagen architecture breakdown to DEJ. Until now, no product addressed the real cause. Our structural renewal system is the first to target what's actually causing your aging, your eye aging. It's too expensive, at $37.46 per bottle on our VSL, costs us the most department store eye creams that don't work, compared to Botox, high-end creams, and dark circles are genetic. While pigmentation is genetic, dark circles are actually caused by broken capillaries and thin skin. Strengthening the skin structure and improving circulation to UD addresses the structural causes. You can improve, not just genetic pigmentation. I don't have time for complicated routines, it takes 30 seconds, morning and night. I'll probably irritate my sensitive skin, specifically formulated for sensitive skin, plus you've got a guarantee. Peptides are just marketing hype, this peptide has clinical studies showing it works. Amazing. And then what about skin? How It gives me a bunch of hook options. If you're like most women over 40, you've probably felt betrayed by your own reflection lately. The money waste angle. A new clinical study reveals why you've wasted thousands of dollars on eye creams that will never work. The beauty industry's $50 billion secret why they don't want you to know the rules in your eyes are aging. Harvard researchers just discovered the hidden cause of eye aging and it's not what you think. At 52, I was spending $300 a month on eye treatments that made me look older, not younger. Then I discovered the money The one thing every expert was getting wrong. Hooks are pretty good. Um, there are, you know, but I wouldn't worry about that too much because I always kind of write the lead separately. Big ideas to test, collagen architectural breakdown theory, DEJ, focus, structural renewal versus surface treatment, contrast, fabric weave Three-step system. Okay, so, it's a lot, but zoom out here and remember what we just did. We just did, got all of that from this prompt. Yes, a link to our website, which does have good information, but I'll address your objection by showing you other examples in a minute. And, um, the mechanism document which we generated and the ingredients. So let's copy this. Let's go put it onto a new document. Make it 150. One of the reasons I'm doing this is because I don't, I actually would rather do changes in Claude, but I want to keep, I was too overall really good, so I just don't want anything to get screwed up, right? So, what I'm going to say is, this was great overall. Really good job. Here are a few, please, core pieces of information for our visions. First off, for the pricing, let's go with the one-time purchase pricing in the VSL. Uhm, can show the subscribe and save options below the VSL. Let's stick with those prices. Second, main speaker be Laura. Uhm, she's a mom of two in Florida. I hope Laura doesn't get mad at me for this, because again, this is not actually true for Laura. I mean, you know, the products are great, but I'm not, I'm using this mostly, mostly for an example. Or I figured her blessing or whatever, but she's beautiful and awesome. Uhm, Florida, uh, departed, noticing, et cetera. Uhm, she ultimately found Dr. Schilling, who helps explain what's really going on. UMP and UMS. The whole VSL will come from Laura, but we'll have her recounting what Dr. Schilling shared. Ultimately, Flora partnered with her. Husband and to create hopeful beauty. I think those are the only big things that we're missing that we didn't have. Everything else, oh yeah. Lastly, let's go with no bonuses in this VSL for now. Okay, so I'm going do that. Just want to make a note while this is doing it. So now Claude's going to revise this stuff for us. You can see why it isn't moving because Claude's doing it once. Adding in stuff. Is it done? Boom. Bam. Thank you there. I think the story, I'm not sure if the story stayed the same. So now you're got Dr. Shilling. Perfect. Okay. Copy. I think it is good enough. I can just replace that for this brief so amazing. So why is it cool? Well, it's cool for many reasons. I want to show you more brief examples in a minute other categories Now that I have this just to give you a little glimpse into the future Should do a medium-length one to start, Comprehensive brief For a new VSL, I should give you everything you need to write it Please review, and I want you to give me an outline for this new VSL Along with your estimated- your estimate for the length, uh, for- How long it'll be, let's aim for, Okay, uhm, so this is a medium length So again, keep in mind, if you know about long VSLs, right, and then I'm gonna take the brief we just had, pop it here Again, I'm gonna explain what this is, basically it's just a Claude project with a bunch of medium length sales letters, and it's telling you, hey, right I don't wanna, like, spoil this, I'll give you a separate training, but I just wanna kinda show you So it's got your hope and opening, problem agitation, three phases of iAging, pillow solutions, financial frustration, emotional impact, cruel heart irony, big revelation, here's what no one told you, the why iGrooms fail There's this. Say, so I think this looks pretty good, right? The one thing I'm thinking about is, Very good. If you get to the big revelation, let's make sure, Laura talks about how she was introduced to Dr. Chalene, and he's the one who shared the real reason. of the UMP and UMS, as it'll still be speaking the whole time as she recounts what Dr. Chalene said. Please go ahead and start writing the VSL now. Okay? And again, I'm going to come back and show you this, these projects for a bunch of things, medium, short, long. Let's just see how it starts going, right? So, would I mention Opal Beauty? Probably not, but, So while it's running, I'll start going, okay? If you're like most women over 40, you've probably felt betrayed by your own reflections lately. Maybe you woke up one morning and noticed crow's feet, or there weren't any before, or you caught a glimpse of yourself in the store window and didn't recognize the tired-looking woman staring back at you. Trust me, I know exactly how that feels. Hi, I'm Laura. I'm the founder at Opal Beauty. You probably wouldn't have mentioned Opal Beauty in the VSL, but that's okay. I'm also a busy mom of two here in Florida, and just a few years ago, I was exactly where you might be right now. I was spending hundreds of dollars every month on eye creams, serums, and treatments, desperately trying to turn back the clock on what felt like overnight aging around my eyes. But here's what's crazy. Despite trying everything from drugstore finds to $300 department store miracle creams, my eyes kept looking older and more tired. The dark circles made me look exhausted, even when I'd had a full night's sleep, the crow's feet seemed to deepen every week, and worst of all, the skin around my eyes had lost that firm, youthful snap that I thought was gone forever. I felt like I was losing a fight or losing a battle, but then something happened that changed everything. At the end of my eye aging, I was introduced to Dr. Blaine Schilling, a leading anti-aging physician of over 30 years of experience, and he told me something that completely shocked me. He said, Laura, the reason your eye creams aren't working has nothing to do with the creams themselves. It's because you're trying to solve the wrong problem. Today, I'm going to share with you exactly what Dr. Schilling told me that the hidden reason why your eye creams have failed you and why it's not what you think. By the end of this presentation, you'll understand exactly what's really causing your eyes to age, and more importantly, you'll discover the breakthrough solution that's finally addressing the root cause. What I'm about to reveal has already helped over 5,800 women transform their eye area in ways they never thought possible, and the best part, it only takes two minutes a day, so please eliminate all distractions and pay close attention to what I'm about to share with you. This could be the answer you've been searching for. So, are there things I would change about this? For sure, and that's why we have a copy cheating module, right? Let me ask you a thing. When you look in the mirror these days, do you sometimes feel like you're looking at a stranger? Because that's exactly how I felt three years ago when I first started noticing what I now call the three phases of eye aging shock. I like this. Phase one was the crow's feet. I swear they appeared literally overnight. One day, I'm putting on my makeup and suddenly there are these lines extending from the corners of my eyes that I'd never seen before. Deep-etched lines that makeup couldn't hide. Phase two was the dark circles. No matter how much sleep I got, how much water I drank, or how many cucumbers I put on my eyes, I was perpetually exhausted. People started asking me if I was feeling okay, if I was getting enough rest. It was embarrassing. And phase three was the worst. That moment when I realized the skin around my eyes had lost its elasticity. You know what I'm talking about. That firm, bouncing quality that young skin has. When I touched the area under my eyes, it felt thin, almost papery, and it would know, stay indented for a moment before slowly bouncing back. I felt like my face was betraying me. So, like any determined woman, I went into research mode. I tried everything. Started with the basic drugstore basics. Cerv√©, Olay, Drogena, the so-called dermatologist-recommended options. After months of religious application, literally nothing changed. If anything, my eyes looked worse. Then I moved up to the prestige department store brands. Estee Lauder, Clinique, even that famous $400 La Mer eye cream everyone raves about. Figured if I was going to spend serious money, I'd get serious results, right? After jumping over $800 in just two months, my eyes looked exactly the same. Actually, they looked worse because I'd wasted two months while the aging continued. Then I discovered The Ordinary and all those active serums everyone talks about online. Retinol, vitamin C, peptides. I thought I was being smart, going for those scientifically-backed ingredients instead of fancy packaging. But here's what happened. My skin became irritated and inflamed, which actually made the dark circles darker. And the wrinkles weren't pronounced. It was like I was making the problem worse. I even went to a dermatologist and asked about professional treatments. Botox, fillers, laser treatments. But at $500 to $2,000 per session, with results that only lasted three to six months, it felt like I would- I'd be trapped in an expensive cycle forever. And the worst part? None of these solutions felt like me. I didn't want to look frozen artificial. I just wanted to look like myself, but younger. Give me one second. I don't want to show them the same thing. Alright, uhm, but at this point I spent thousands of dollars. I know I'm like, why am I- I was gonna do this in the whole other module, but screw you, you should be watching this module. And I just want you to see, uhm. My friend mentioned Dr. Schilling. I mean, I guess I'll go through it in more depth later, but basically, look, it's like, like when I say testimonials, no. It's like, it's like a good VSL. Like, I kind of want to keep going through the whole thing, but I guess I'll do this in a separate one so you don't kill me. Cause it feel, this is cool, Rmbc1 was the same way, it's like, kind of feels like you're doing a lot, but not really. It's like you created a unified research document, created mechanisms, and then now you have the brief. But the brief, like, you created with AI, so it was super fast and good, and now you have a medium length VSL, which is frankly quite good. Now it's like, there's things we would do again, like we'll test, add stuff to the lead, uhm, you know, a little copy editing, blah, blah, blah, blah. But it's like, definitely not bad, right? And, I promise and I swear I won't do the whole thing of this. Now it's for a medium length VSL, right? Okay, cool. But I wanna do, an ADHD hook one, I'll do a short one, I'll do a short one. Okay, cool. Umm, second. Let's do it. So. I am really proud. I'll write down so you guys have them, but like, uh, you know. Because they're short, I'm asking for multiple concepts. Uh. Then, um, please review, and then give me, 5 to 10 short PSL concepts you think will be worth testing. By the way, if I already had the hooks, which I believe I did, uh, you've already seen the hook training, I could also give it some hooks too. For now, I won't do that, okay? Scientific betrayal hook, 0 or 0 or 0, spending in tons of stuff. There's a scientific reason why the business here is what you find out, okay. So, I'm gonna go over these in more depth later. I like this one. It's kinda bad. Turn it over to our iCrami bot. Last month, according to research, just to actually make your eyes and worse, here's what department stores want you to know. I got like a 3-step system hook as well. I have an appearance hook. So again, so these hooks are actually pretty good already. I guess your recommendations. I start with 2, 3, and 5. I like 6 personally, so, you know. Thanks for that. Let's go ahead and start with number 6. Umm, please write a 3-minute DSL. And now, for this DSL, don't reveal the price. Instead, the call to action will be to visit a whole beauties website and save, Uhh, okay. So let's just see how that does, okay? I'm gonna order some Jersey Mike's Wallace's doing it. Cause why not? Although, frankly, that'd be kinda fast, right? It's already ready in it. Alright, boom, bam, look at that. I'm literally ordering Postmates, give me, sorta myself a side of an order. For my wife of sub, while it's doing that. And we have Eden of Sub 2, ooh, my daughter. I usually don't say her name publicly, but it's alright. Alright, I I wanna, I wanna let this sink in. It literally takes me longer to order sandwiches on Postmates than it does to write VSL as a copy. Does that not blow your mind? Cause it should. Alright, let's look at the copy. Hopefully it's good, okay? That 200R came you bought last month, according to your research, it's actually making your eye aging worse. Here's what department stores don't want you to know. If you're in winter of 40, you spent hundreds of even thousands of eye treatments that promise miracles, but delivered to deployment, this video will change everything you thought you knew about eye aging. Here's what's really happening when you buy this expensive department store eye creams. You're paying Hey, if you're, Your prices for outdated science only shoots the surface of your skin, so try to fix the collapsing house for paying the walls. Meanwhile, the real destruction is happening deep beneath the surface, a sign called the dermal epidermal junction. The foundations where your skin layers connect. And here's the shocking truth. Every day you use those surface treatments, you're watching your money drain away while the real prong gets worse. I'm Laura, founder of a beauty. I learned this the hard way. I 42 as a busy mom of two in Florida. I was Laura's in 42. She's younger than that at the time of making this video. So, again, don't worry, kill me. I was that woman hiding behind sunglasses because my eyes were made look exhausted even when I wasn't. I tried everything. Drug store creams, $300 apartment store miracles, even consulting dermatologists, nothing worked. That's what my doctor believes in. I'll be needing that to age in position for over 30 years of experience. I told myself to change everything I thought I knew about I aging. Laura said the problem is just about college and loss. It's called, It's called, ocean architecture breakdown happening at the terminal. Again, this is too confusing, maybe, somebody I'll edit later. Um, and it has like the fabric weaving thing. This is why your expressive eye creams fail. They're trying to add more threads to already broken fabric instead of fixing to leave itself. When your skin's foundation breaks down to the DEJ, all these bad things happen. But here's the breakthrough. We developed what we call the structural renewal system, the first treatment that actually repairs the organized structure of your s skin's foundation. Okay, breaks down what it is, social proof. Right now, you get your ice cream, let's say it was a 50% off, but only we needed it directly, don't waste that off. Okay, cool. Let's just do one more. Um, so great. Thanks. Now, let's do a, let's do number eight. Let's keep it to about. about two minutes. Alright, now let's do number eight. Well, you've been fighting college and loss through a lot of minutes from winning, but this three step breakthrough changes, everything about how we approach our aging. If you're ever forwarding, tired of watching your eyes betray, how young you feel inside, the next two minutes will reveal. But why every eye treatment you've tried has been fighting the wrong battle. Here's one of the times when I aging, everyone thinks the problem is in college and so they create treatments to try to add more caution to your skin. That's like trying to fix a torn sweater by throwing more yarn at it, instead of repairing the actual weave. The real problem is in college and loss, it's college and architecture breakdown. Your skin's foundation is literally falling apart at the dermal epidermal junction where your skin layers connect. The organized structure that kept your eyes smooth and firm is becoming loose tingled in chaos. That's why adding more caution doesn't work. I didn't thread it to the broken fabric. I'm Laura. So I work in Dr. Rose Shilling. It's got a solution. It's about not a lot more collagen. It's organized collagen. So we developed the most first structural renewal system. Instead of the old approach of just adding greens through your skin, our breakthrough works in three precise steps. Signal repair or lock. This is a theory of proven science, clinical studies, testimonials called action, right? So, I know this video is kind of becoming long, but I mean, come on. Come on. Umm. Here's the brief for AVSL. Umm. Hook add. I'm with that, please. Me, 5, AVHD. Hook add concepts to choose from. Okay. One more time, just so you can see. Actually, not many long VSL's too. Okay, I just really want you to see, you know, how, how full this is. Okay, I classed with one, near a betrayal. That's up to you with 3,000, uh, thousand, uh, eye, green graveyard. Skin layer separation. I like this, this is what's really happening under your crow's feet. I'm actually gonna, I'm just gonna say, highlight concept number 3. The most, let's lead with, I really like that line. Umm, let's have the CTA be to save money, to save some percent off their order when they visit the website. Umm, head and right, The Scripps. Nah. I gave him much other, it's probably some other one too, but I just liked that one. This is what's really happening under your crow's feet. Your skin layers are separate right now and you don't even know it. Do you know your eye area, under your eye area has the foundation of scrumbling? The number one reason Botox doesn't work long term. Most women over four women realize the separation is happening beneath their skin. I'm Laura's when- over $3,000 in eye creams, um, before a doctor over 30 years experienced so much saying that changes everything. Think of your skin like high quality fabric that's much stretch until the weave breaks apart. This breakdown starts years before you see wrinkles, your skin looks- your skin hooks are disappearing and taking your ears with it. I don't like the skin, so I might change that. Couldn't I probably remove that from the beef. Testimony- Come on in. I feel I tried everything. Every eye cream you try attacks the wrong problem. There's a hidden layer under your skin and that determines how old you look. The separation happens to 99% of women over 40. Most doctors don't even know about college and architecture breakdown. The industry doesn't want you to know about the DEJ breakdown. 51% of small fortune. On eye creams, and this is a clear winner of a 10 years younger. This works even if genetics give you bad eye bags. At 62, my new aesthetician was amazed at how useful my eye area looks. The results are incredible. There's a three-step system that rebuilds your eye area from the inside out. By the time you see crow's feet, the damage started years ago. Your eye area ages 5x faster because of the structural weakness. The spray time of sorry it's after 40 and most women never recover. The change happens so gradually you don't notice until it's severe. I'm revealing exactly how to reverse college. You can start to break down using our way through DEG renewal system. Um, quickly below right now to say 50% off your order and it's got a three-step system that's changing everything about it. Honestly, I probably could have done say 50% or 7% off to get more information because this has really ran more to like sell the solution than to sell the product. Um, like to sell the VSL. I know there's a lot of like little things about you should have already watched this training by the time you're on here so you know what these hook ads are. Um, that's- It's good. It's solid, right? Um, I guess it's all from the same brief. And then it's like, okay, last one, right? A long form VSL for our brand. Well, beauty. Um. Please provide an outline. Uhh, tell me the estimated length. Plus. Uhm. A shoot for about, 25 minutes. Well, I have to do a little longer, 28 minutes long. I I don't remember this whole thing, but let's just see, right? I have to prove the outline, and you can write the VSL. I mean, as a quick teaser, it's like I've got somewhat of a VSL, so everything from more expensive things, or more, uh, aggressive things. To much more compliant things, blah, blah. Let's see how it, what it gives us. So let's give it 20 minutes. Alright, interesting, right? And again, I might be more picky. I'll do actual VSL, you know, writing modules. We can come back to this stuff a little bit. Alright. Well, we're an attractive for you at once. Not for two, but she's attractive. Um, again, I wouldn't worry about the lead that much. You view this more as the background. There's a hidden process hiding coming in a deep place of sorts of your eyes. Let's go to your stand-up. I don't need to repeat that. My name is Laura Thing. That's okay. So anyway, it's still going. I could tell it to continue. There's a lot of things we'll go for. What I want to get across from you now, if I zoom back out, and it's a long video, but hopefully your mind is kind of blown, is like, once we generate that pre- brief. We can do so much stuff with it. We can write so much copy. We can crush, crush, crush, crush, crush. All right, I'm gonna do another video. This can have some other examples. And There will have things that we don't have a website to go off of. Umm, in some cases we just have a list of ingredients, but two that will be information based as well. So. Yeah, I would say. Definitely stay tuned. And I will see you shortly. Thank you. Bye.

Alright, let's do two more examples here. Sorry, my headset is not on. There it goes. I think it's on now. Alright, so in this case, let's just say that you only have the ingredient research. So I just took that blood sugar supplement, uh, from the research module from before when I was doing them, Xylitol, right, whatever it is. And. I think I have a prompt here. The right one. It's going to just be, when you're helped during a new brief for a, uh, new blood sugar supplement VSL, I'm attaching ingredients list and studies for your reference. Please watch, this is important, okay? So say, honestly, I'm not encouraging you to be Thank Doing, like, the dark arts, but There is the power for somebody to, you know, abuse this, because, look, Please use placeholders to come up with the strongest brief possible. I will switch out everything later, but I want to see an example of what this brief can look like. And I put, let's have this brief, this VSL, because I think you need to kind of know who this spokesperson is, you know. Uh, come from the perspective of, Perspective of a woman who has a personal struggle with diabetes, either her own blood sugar is high, or someone close to hers is, and who meets an expert who helps show her the real solution, please go ahead and get started now, okay? We've got that and that. That's the exact same prompt, those are the ingredients. Let's do it, who's the audience? By the way, so I didn't give a mark of research in this one. I didn't give it a mechanism. Keep that in mind, right? That's important. Now, I said the primary audience is women. Okay, I don't think that's true. We're women and men. You know. We can tell it feedback, we might have to make a note, right? I think the audience is women and men. I think having it be primarily women is fine, but I wouldn't ignore men. Okay. Struggle with, or pre-diabetic, or have type 2 diabetes, struggling with blood sugar management despite following traditional medical advice, they're health-conscious but frustrated with conventional treatments that either don't work well enough or come with unwanted side effects. Secondary audience for one who's loved one. Spouse, parent, child are struggling with diabetes and they're seeking natural solutions to help them. What are the pain points or biggest fears? Fear of progressing from pre-diabetes to full type 2 diabetes or from type 2 to insulin dependence. Constant anxiety about blood sugar spikes and crashes affecting daily life, energy, and mood. Terror of diabetic complications, blindness, amputation, kidney failure, or heart disease. Secondary pain points. Daily energy crashes, brain fog, constant hunger cravings. Mood swings. Frequent urination. Disrupted sleep. Long-term weight gain, accelerated aging, reduced quality of life. Becoming a burden on family and medical expenses. What are the big promises about the spouse copy? I'm going to reveal the real reason your blood sugar stays high and it's not what your doctor told you. You'll discover the ancient blood sugar reset ritual that Harvard researchers say works better than most prescription medications. I'll show you why everything you've been told about managing diabetes is backwards and the simple 30-second daily habit that can change everything. You'll learn about the pancreas protection protocol that's been hiding from diabetics for decades. What does it look like? Hang on, you might not love this name, but I wouldn't really get into picky on that for right now. I'd be like, all right, let's just see the overall picture. What does it look like when their pain point has been solved? Stable blood sugar readings throughout the day, 80 to 120 milligrams per DL range. Consistent energy levels about afternoon crashes. Effortless weight gain. Weight management. Reduced belly fat. Better sleep quality. Feeling refreshed upon waking. Reduced cravings for sugary processed foods. Emotional benefits. Confidence and peace of mind about their health future. Freedom from constant blood sugar, monitoring, and anxiety. Feeling in control of their body again. Pride in taking charge of their health naturally. Social and psychological benefits. Not having to worry about what to eat at social gatherings. Being the inspiration for family and friends. Feeling attracted to and confident in their body. No longer feeling like a sick person. What solutions exist and why aren't they working? Prescription medication. Side effects. Don't address it for a cause. Expensive. Create dependency. Restrictive diets. Exercise programs. Blood sugar monitors. Generic supplements. Unique mechanism. Remember, we gave it no unique mechanism. We just gave it studies. The real culprit behind stubborn blood sugar is anxiety. This isn't just diet and exercise, it's glucose transport dysfunction. Most people's cells have become resistant to insulin because their glucose transporters, the tiny doors that let sugar into cells, have become sluggish and inefficient. This happens due to chronic inflammation in the gut and cellular membranes caused by modern processed foods and environmental toxins. Think of it like this. Your insulin is knocking on the cell door, but the door is rusty and stuck. The sugar stays in your bloodstream because it can't get into the cells where it belongs. Traditional treatments focus on making more insulin, which creates more problems, instead of fixing the broken doors. Unique mechanism of the solution. The solution is glucose transport restoration using specific natural compounds that act like a cellular door oil to restore proper GLUT4 function. These compounds work in three ways. Reactivate dormant glucose transporters, like switching on broken doors. Reduce cellular inflammation, removing the rust from the hinges. Enhance insulin sensitivity, making the key turn smoothly in the lock. When you restore proper glucose transport, your cells can efficiently use sugar for energy instead of letting it circulate in your blood, causing damage. Unique nicknames for the unique mechanism. The cellular door fix. 30-second blood sugar reset ritual. Main ingredients. These are the ingredients and the studies, which we've pulled before. Bold product claims. Naturally support healthy blood sugar levels within 30 days. Help store your body's natural glucose transport system. Support pancreatic health and insulin sensitivity. May reduce sugar cravings and energy crashes. Clinically studied ingredients shown to support glucose metabolism. Okay, good. These are pretty compliant claims, which is nice. Obviously, somebody who is more aggressive might do, uh, more aggressive ones, but these are good. Um, there's always a chew, the thing we did before. Uh, delicious natural berry flavored chewable tablets. 9 clinically researched natural ingredients. Convenient chewable format. No naturally sweetened xylitol. Also supports blood sugar. Third party tested. Made in FDA. Registered GMP certified facility. Vegan, gluten-free, non-GMO. Supports this stuff. Back on the story. Sarah Martinez, 52, a mother of two from Austin, Texas. Discovered she was pre-diabetic during a routine checkup in 2019. Despite following her doctor's advice, cutting carbs, exercise daily, taking metformin, her blood sugar continued to creep upward. She watched her own mother lose her sight to diabetic complications and was terrified of the same fate. After her father was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and started experiencing dangerous blood sugar swings, Sarah became desperate. Traditional treatments weren't working for either of them. During a family emergency at the hospital, she met Dr. whoever it is, an endocrinologist who specializes in metabolic office. disorders. The doctor explained that most diabetes treatments focus on managing symptoms rather than addressing the root cause, damaged glucose transport systems at the cellular level. He introduced Sarah to emerging research on natural compounds that could restore proper glucose transport function. Working together, they developed a specific protocol using research-backed natural ingredients. Within 90 days, Sarah's blood sugar stabilized, her energy returned, and her father's dangerous spikes stopped. One of the family members in her friends saw the results. They begged Sarah to share the secret. Who's the main speaker? Okay, Sarah. Second speaker, if we have him, Dr. So-and-so, board-certified endocrinologist, 15 years of experience, published author, uh, provides the scientific credibility. Seeing the results, Sarah partnered with a company named Respectful Natural Health Company of 20 plus years of experience. They helped her scale the formula, ensure pharmaceutical grade quality and consistency. So I lost 23 pounds, my A1C dropped, tomorrow afternoon crashes, stopped taking metformin with doctor's approval, uhm, so things like this, right? Credibility builders told me Harvard researchers recently discovered clinical studies published in peer-reviewed medical journals. Ingredients backed by over 20 human clinical trials, recommended by X number of healthcare practitioners, featured in here. Normal price, BSL price per bottle, doesn't work. So $136.49, I would do the price per bottle on this, but still basically the discounted pricing, uhm, guarantee, bonuses, 7 day blood sugar reset meal plan, 21 blood sugar friendly recipes, a complete guide to reading blood sugar signals, scarcity elements, supply chains, limit three bottles per customer I mean If you're doing a six bottle, you may not want that, so you need to think still. Uhm, future pace results, so same thing here. It's so funny because they're so compliant, like, throughout, like, the product claims. And the hook, the 30 second blood sugar ritual that's required. Reversing type 2 diabetes in thousands of Americans, and why big pharmas try to hide it. Former pre-diabetic discovers the cellular door. Secret that Harvard researchers say works better than metformin. Why everything you've been told about blood sugar is backwards, and the ancient spice is proving doctors wrong. The shocking reason your blood sugar won't go down. Hint, it's not what you're eating. How a desperate daughter saved her diabetic father with a discovery that's now helping thousands avoid insulin. Not bad. That's a bad hook, so you get a little aggressive. But, again, when you look at this, it's, like, pretty cool, when you think about how we just did ingredients, and it gave you an entire thing, including a mechanism, and, you know, again, what you can do is, like, you're the, like, the director, you're, like, the boss, like, the copy chief, or, like, the CMO, or whatever it is, so, like, really, you just, you know, hey, cool, but I think, uhm, it's woman and man. Hey, you know, let's have the doctor be this person, or, like, Thank Hey, let's change this with the mechanism, right? You can just give it feedback, and it'll keep tweaking it until it's good. So, like, when would I use this, besides if I was doing, like, kind of more aggressive stuff? Uhm, honestly, if you're tasked, if you have, like, a new formula, and you're gonna write a VSL, or even just copy in general for it, it might be worth just throwing it in. Running the brief thing a couple of times, and just see what it comes up with, because you're probably gonna get a bunch of, you know, useful stuff, like the pain points are probably pretty accurate, like, the promises might get some really good ones, you might tweak them a little bit, uhm, the future pace benefits are pretty good, the existing solutions is fine, like, the unique mechanism, it might, maybe it gives you a really good chance of a unique mechanism, right, uhm, a really good nickname, very good ingredient studies that you can always have, like, a lot of this would probably be good, maybe it kind of gives you an idea for how to present a real life story that you already have, right, uhm, and again, like, hey, you know, let's change these words, the doctor, a doctor's patient comes in, she's struggling, the doctor goes on a quest, I could tell it that right now, does it make sense? I'm gonna go slower, I know I talk fast. So I could be like, hey, now do a version where, watch, I'll show you, copy that, okay. That's great, thank you. I would like to. I would like to see a second version of the brief where it comes from a doc, from the doctor. Uh, let's have him share a story of a patient who was at her wit's end about her high blood sugar. He can tell more about her suffering. The doctor says he felt helpless and decided to go on a quest to figure out why so many, still, so many patients still struggle with high blood sugar despite all the medications, artificial sweeteners, solutions out there. This ultimately led him to discover PMP, UMS, ingredients, and, uh, formula. so it should still keep this version up here. So I'm gonna do, like, I'm gonna put it, let me do that. Okay, and now what I'm gonna do is copy and paste this while it's writing it. Let's go V2, all right. Ahem, and we'll copy and paste this, right? Create a comment instead of, okay, so it's still doing this other one, right? So this one did a doll, it's not just woman, which is interesting. So it's worth noticing how it's doing this one a little bit different. What's interesting is it's sort of like doing this one from the perspective of a doctor, What does it look like? Okay, but it's still good, blood sugar, things, maybe medication, I mean, it's trusting their body, still shitting on these other things, same UMP, same UMS, same ingredients, bullet product claims, what's the product, doctor, right, uhm, it's by evidence- following evidence-based protocols and staying current with the latest treatments you watch helplessly as many of his patients. Continue to deteriorate. Training point came when you met Margaret, a 58-year-old teacher, and devoted grandmother. Margaret had followed every recommendation perfectly for three years, took her metformin religiously, monitored blood sugar, exercised five days a week, and maintained a strict low-carb diet. Yeah, her A1c kept climbing, 7.2 and 7.8 and 8.4. Doctor knew everything you told me, you know, through tears, during what would become a life-changing appointment. I've given up foods I love, I take pills that make me nauseous, I exercise to get rid of my exhaustion. My numbers keep getting worse, what am I doing wrong? Doctor realized he had no good answer, Margaret wasn't doing anything wrong, the system was failing her. He began questioning everything he'd learned in medical school about diabetes treatment. He dove into meridian research on cellular metabolism, glucose transport mechanisms, the molecular basis of insulin resistance, what he discovered shocked him. After months of research, he realized that conventional diabetes treatment was like trying to fix a flooding hospital. By installing bigger pumps, while ignoring the broken pipes, we were forcing more insulin into the system with damaged glucose transport mechanisms. Doctor began investigating natural compounds that could repair cellular glucose transport. He found promising research on traditional medicines and bioactive plant compounds that worked at a molecular level. Presented his findings to Margaret, who came from monitoring, and began incorporating these natural compounds alongside our traditional treatment. The 90 days for A1C dropped, the best it had been in years. The 90 for energy return, blah blah, were to spread among his patients, sourcing pharmaceutical ingredients, ensuring proper dosages was challenging, here's the expert, here's Margaret, the partner of a brand, testimonials, credibility, pricing's the same, the rest of it's the same, right? So, now you have one with a totally different structure, if you want to use that one, and you can do both. Decide, right? Uhm, so, cool, I think, hopefully you agree, we'll come back, we'll do one more, this will be for a financial webinar type of one, so, stay tuned.
